| <span id="v1" data-verse="44:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Ha. Mim. | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="44:2" data-tags="">2</span> | By the Scripture that maketh plain | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="44:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="44:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Whereon every wise command is made clear | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="44:5" data-tags="">5</span> | As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="44:6" data-tags="">6</span> | A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="44:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would be sure. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="44:8" data-tags="">8</span> | There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and Lord of your forefathers. | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="44:9" data-tags="">9</span> | Nay, but they play in doubt. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="44:10" data-tags="">10</span> | But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce visible smoke | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="44:11" data-tags="">11</span> | That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="44:12" data-tags="">12</span> | (Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are believers. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="44:13" data-tags="">13</span> | How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain (the Truth) had already come unto them, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="44:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a madman ? | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="44:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="44:16" data-tags="">16</span> | On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth We shall punish. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="44:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them a noble messenger, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="44:18" data-tags="">18</span> | Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="44:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="44:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to death. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="44:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="44:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="44:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be followed, | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="44:24" data-tags="">24</span> | And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="44:25" data-tags="">25</span> | How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="44:26" data-tags="">26</span> | And the cornlands and the goodly sites | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="44:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And pleasant things wherein they took delight! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="44:28" data-tags="">28</span> | Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="44:29" data-tags="">29</span> | And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="44:30" data-tags="">30</span> | And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="44:31" data-tags="">31</span> | (We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="44:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="44:33" data-tags="">33</span> | And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="44:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="44:35" data-tags="">35</span> | There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="44:36" data-tags="">36</span> | Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="44:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="44:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in play. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="44:39" data-tags="">39</span> | We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="44:40" data-tags="">40</span> | Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="44:41" data-tags="">41</span> | A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="44:42" data-tags="">42</span> | Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="44:43" data-tags="">43</span> | Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="44:44" data-tags="">44</span> | The food of the sinner! | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="44:45" data-tags="">45</span> | Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="44:46" data-tags="">46</span> | As the seething of boiling water. | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="44:47" data-tags="">47</span> | (And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="44:48" data-tags="">48</span> | Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="44:49" data-tags="">49</span> | (Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="44:50" data-tags="">50</span> | Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="44:51" data-tags="">51</span> | Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="44:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Amid gardens and watersprings, | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="44:53" data-tags="">53</span> | Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="44:54" data-tags="">54</span> | Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely eyes. | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="44:55" data-tags="">55</span> | They call therein for every fruit in safety. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="44:56" data-tags="">56</span> | They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them from the doom of hell, | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="44:57" data-tags="">57</span> | A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="44:58" data-tags="">58</span> | And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may heed. | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="44:59" data-tags="">59</span> | Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting. | |
