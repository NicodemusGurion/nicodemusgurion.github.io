Surah 3:1

> Alif-Lâm-Mîm. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings].

Like [chapter 2](/quran-2/) this chapter starts with three meaningless letters. I like how Al-Hilali & Khan's translation inserts the explanation that this is somehow a miracle. No, Muslims. That is not what the word "miracle" means. Three random meaningless letters is not a "miracle".

Surah 3:3-4

> It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur’ân) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) aforetime, as a guidance to mankind. 

This verse confirms the Bible as the word of Allah. Muslims who dispute this disputes the Quran, which is kafr.

Surah 3:7

> He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive.1 Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah.

Surah 16:89 says that the Quran explains all things, and Surah 11:1 says "˹This is˺ a Book whose verses are well perfected and then fully explained." So which one is it? Is it clear and comprehensive? Or are some verses clear and others shrouded in confusion?
