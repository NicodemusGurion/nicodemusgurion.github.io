Claim: The Bible teaches abuse of women, therefore the abuse of women that Islam teaches is justified.

Why it’s false:

While Islam directly commands its male followers to beat women, and teaches that women are deficient in intelligence, religion, and only worth half of a man in court, the Bible never commands anything remotely like it. The Bible may depict the sinful behavior of some humans who mistreated women, but every biblical law and command regarding how to treat women is loving and enlightened, and the Bible describes a God who loves, dignifies, respects, protects, and cherishes women.

### Paul said that women should be silent

1 Corinthian 14:34,35

The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.

This is not Paul speaking. He is quoting a false belief that the Corinthian congregation held. You can see that it is a false belief because it claims that the law says that women should be silent. But there is no law in the Mosaic law code or anywhere else that says this. Paul was a lawyer and would never make that mistake. And even if there was such a law, Paul is famous for teaching that Christians are not under the Mosaic law. So whoever is saying this is not Paul, and the person is wrong.

From the context we see that the passage deals with speaking in tongues. What happened is that some faction or person professing to be a prophet in the Corinthian congregation tries to forbid women from speaking in tongues. So Paul goes on in the following verses using rhetorical irony to criticize them for playing prophets and making up false rules. He's directly ordering them to "do not forbid the speaking of tongues", and saying that if they do not recognize that this is the truth, they are not recognized as true prophets.
