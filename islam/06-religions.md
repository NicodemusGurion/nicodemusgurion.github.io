## Apostasy and hypocrisy

How to deal with those who leave islam.

### Punishment for apostasy is death {#apostasy-death-sentence}

[Surah 4:89](https://quran.com/4/89)

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, **then seize them and kill them wherever you find them**, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2535](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2535)

> The Messenger of Allah said:“Whoever changes his religion, execute him.”

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6922](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6922)

> Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn Abbas who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"

### Give apostates a chance to repent, and if they don't, kill them


[Muwatta Malik 36:15](https://sunnah.com/urn/514180)

> the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "If someone changes his deen (religion) - strike his neck!" The meaning of the statement of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in our opinion and Allah knows best, is that "if someone changes his deen, strike his neck!" refers to those who leave Islam for other than it - like the heretics and their like, about whom it is known. They are killed without being called to tawba (repentance) because their tawba is not recognised. They were hiding their kufr and publishing their Islam, so I do not think that one calls such people to tawba, and one does not accept their word. As for the one who goes out of Islam to something else and divulges it, one calls him to tawba. If he does not turn in tawba, he is killed. If there are people in that situation, I think that one should call them to Islam and call them to tawba. If they turn in tawba, that is accepted from them. If they do not turn in tawba, they are killed.

## Leaving Islam

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4061](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4061)

> "The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever changes his religion, kill him.'"


### A man was beheaded for apostasy

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4356](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4356)

> Abu Burdah said: A man who turned back from Islam was brought to Abu Musa. He invited him to repent for twenty days or about so. Muadh then came and invited him (to embrace Islam) but he refused. So he was beheaded.

### Kill hypocrites

[Sahih Muslim 1066 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1066)

> I heard the Messenger of Allah as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of Judgement.

Muslims should kill false Muslims.


[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4102](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4102)

> It was narrated that 'Ali said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'At the end of time there will appear young people with foolish minds. Their faith will not pass through their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes through the target. If you meet them, then kill them, for **killing them will bring reward to the one who killed them** on the Day of Resurrection.'"

Killing hypocrite Muslims brings a reward.

## Muslims may not resemble Jews or Christians

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2695](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2695)

> the Messenger of Allah said: "He is not one of us who resembles other than us, no who resembles the Jews nor the Christians. For indeed greeting of the Jews is pointing the finger, and the greeting of the Christians is waving with the hand."


So if you point with your finger, wave with your hand, or do anything else that the Jews and Christians are doing, such as praying prostrate, you are not a Muslim.


## Islamic worship

### Islam means following Muhammad 

[Surah 4:65](https://quran.com/4/65)

> But no! By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they accept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes, and find no resistance within themselves against your decision and submit wholeheartedly.

### Muslims must love Muhammad more than anyone else

[Sunan Ibn Majah 67](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:67)

> It was narrated that Anas bin Malik said: "The Messenger of Allah said: 'None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.'"

### Don't come to mosque with garlic breath {#garlic}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5451)

> Narrated Abdul Aziz: It was said to Anas "What did you hear the Prophet  saying about garlic?" Anas replied, "Whoever has eaten (garlic) should not approach our mosque."


## The future of Islam


### The goal of Islam is world domination

[Mishkat al-Masabih 42](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:42)

> Miqdad reported that he heard God’s messenger say, “There will not remain on the face of the earth a mud-brick house or a camel’s hair tent which God will not cause the confession of Islam to enter bringing both mighty honour and abject abasement. God will either honour the occupants and put them among its adherents, or will humiliate them and they will be subject to it.” Miqdad said, “God will then receive complete obedience.”

### Islam will split into 73 sects

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3992](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3992)

>  the Messenger of Allah said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy in Hell. The Christians split into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which will be in Hell and one in Paradise. I swear by the One Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, my nation will split into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two in Hell.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, who are they?” He said: “The main body.”

## Islam is a strange serpent receding into its hole {#strange-serpent}

[Sahih Muslim 146](https://sunnah.com/muslim:146)

> the Messenger of Allah observed: Verily Islam started as something strange and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.

If he was a prophet then let's hope this prophecy comes true at least.


### End time fake Muslims foretold

[Sahih Muslim 1066 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1066)

> I heard the Messenger of Allah as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur'an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of Judgement.

So there would be Muslims who falsely claim to be Muslims. And muslims should kill the false Muslims.


[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4102](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4102)

> It was narrated that 'Ali said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'At the end of time there will appear young people with foolish minds. Their faith will not pass through their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes through the target. If you meet them, then kill them, for **killing them will bring reward to the one who killed them** on the Day of Resurrection.'"

# Non-Muslims in general {#non-muslims}

## View of non-Muslims

[Surah 98:6](https://quran.com/98/6)

> Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the worst of ˹all˺ beings

Islam views non-Muslims as the worst of all beings.


## Do not befriend non-muslims 

[Surah 3:28](https://quran.com/3/28)

> Believers should not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers—and whoever does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah—unless it is a precaution against their tyranny.

[Surah 5:51](https://quran.com/5/51)

> You who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies:they are allies only to each other. Anyone who takes them as an ally becomes one of them- God does not guide such wrongdoers

Think you have a Muslim friend? Think again. Muslims are not allowed to be your friend, but will only pretend to be friendly to deceive.

## Do not insult unbelievers or they will insult Allah

[Surah 6:108](https://quran.com/6/108)

> ˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. 


## Non-Muslims are the worst of creatures

[Surah 98:6](https://quran.com/98/6)

> Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein. They are the worst of creatures

# Jews and Christians {#people-of-the-book}

## Do not greet Jews and Christians but bully them

[Sahih Muslim 2167 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2167)

> Do not greet the Jews and the Christians before they greet you and when you meet any one of them on the roads force him to go to the narrowest part of it.

Muslims are to bully Jews and Christians by not greeting them first and force them to yield on the road.

## Jews and Christians to be expelled from Arabia

[Sahih Muslim 1767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1767a)

> I will expel the Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula and will not leave any but Muslim

- [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1606](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1606)
- [Bulugh al-Maram 11:46](https://sunnah.com/bulugh/11/46)
- [Mishkat al-Masabih 4053](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:4053)

## Jews and Christians who don't accept Islam go to hell


[Sahih Muslim 153](https://sunnah.com/muslim:153)

> he who amongst the community of Jews or Christians hears about me, but does not affirm his belief in that with which I have been sent and dies in this state (of disbelief), he shall be but one of the denizens of Hell-Fire.

See also:

- [Mishkat al-Masabih 10](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:10)


## Jews and Christians are worth half as much as Muslims {#worth-half}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2644](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2644)

> the Messenger of Allah ruled that the blood money for the people of the book is half of that of the blood money for the Muslims, and they are the Jews and Christians.

See also:

- [Sunan an-Nasa'i 4806](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4806)


## Muslims should listen to and learn from Christians and Jews {#listen-to-christians}

[Surah 29:46](https://quran.com/29/46)

> Do not argue with the People of the Book unless gracefully, except with those of them who act wrongfully. 

[Surah 16:43](https://quran.com/16/43)[;21:7](https://quran.com/21/7)

> [Prophet], all the messengers We sent before you were simply men to whom We had given the Revelation: you [people] can ask those who have knowledge if you do not know.

[Surah 10:94](https://quran.com/10/94)

> If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,

Muslims should not argue with Christians but listen and learn from them what Allah has really taught.


## The Jews and Christians did have the uncorrupted scriptures in the days of Muhammad 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2653](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2653)

> The Tawrah and Injil are with the Jews and Christians


## Jizya

Jizya is a tax that Islam demands from Jews and Christians in exchange for not killing them.

[Surah 9:29](https://quran.com/9/29)

> Fight those of the People of the Book who do not [truly] believe in God and the Last Day, who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, who do not obey the rule of justice,until they pay the [jizya] tax and agree to submit.

[Sahih Muslim 1731a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

> …If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.…

This is the future of your country if you invite Islam: They will sooner or later take over, and if you do not join their ideology, you will have to pay a tax to them. And if you refuse to pay them, they will kill you.



# Jews


## Allah favors Jews

[Surah 45:16](https://quran.com/45/16)

[Surah 5:21](https://quran.com/5/21)

> O my people! Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you. Turn not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers:


## A tribe of Israelites were turned into rats {#rats}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3305](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3305)

> The Prophet said, "A group of Israelites were lost. Nobody knows what they did. But I do not see them except that they were cursed and changed into rats, for if you put the milk of a she-camel in front of a rat, it will not drink it, but if the milk of a sheep is put in front of it, it will drink it."


## Jews are equal to asses and pigs {#pigs}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 789](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:789)

> When one of you prays without a sutra, an ass, a pig, a Jew, a Magian, and a woman cut off his prayer.

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

# Christians

## Christians must judge by the Gospel {#judge-by-gospel}

[Surah 5:47](https://quran.com/5/47)

> So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.

## Allah promised that Christians will be superior until judgment day 

[Surah 3:55](https://quran.com/3/55)

> God said, ‘Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Me: I will purify you of the disbelievers. To the Day of Resurrection **I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieved.**
