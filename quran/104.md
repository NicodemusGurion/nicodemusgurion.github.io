> <span id="v1">1</span> Woe unto every slandering traducer,

> <span id="v2">2</span> Who hath gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it.

> <span id="v3">3</span> He thinketh that his wealth will render him immortal.

> <span id="v4">4</span> Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One.

> <span id="v5">5</span> Ah, what will convey unto you what the Consuming One is!

> <span id="v6">6</span> (It is) the fire of Allah, kindled,

> <span id="v7">7</span> Which leapeth up over the hearts (of men).

> <span id="v8">8</span> Lo! it is closed in on them

> <span id="v9">9</span> In outstretched columns.
