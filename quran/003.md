###### 1

Surah 3:1

> Alif-Lâm-Mîm. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings].

Like [chapter 2](/quran-2/) this chapter starts with three meaningless letters. I like how Al-Hilali & Khan's translation inserts the explanation that this is somehow a miracle. No, Muslims. That is not what the word "miracle" means. Three random meaningless letters is not a "miracle". 

###### 3

Surah 3:3-4

> It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur’ân) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) aforetime, as a guidance to mankind. 

This verse confirms the Bible as the word of Allah. Muslims who dispute this disputes the Quran, which is kafr.


####### 7

Surah 3:7

> He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive. Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah.

Surah 16:89 says that the Quran explains all things, and Surah 11:1 says "˹This is˺ a Book whose verses are well perfected and then fully explained." So which one is it? Is it clear and comprehensive? Or are some verses clear and others shrouded in confusion?

###### 10

Surah 3:10

> The disbelievers will be fuel for the Fire

Meaning, the fire of hell. The Biblical concept of hell and the Islamic concept of hell are different. In the Bible, hell was created for Sayan and his angels, and rebellious humans are only deposited there as a final solution when all else fails, but they were never really meant to be there. The fires of hell don't require any fuel.

In the Islamic hell, as [other verses point out](/quran/2/#24), was made specifically because Allah wanted to torture some people. Also the fires of Islamic hell require fuel to burn, and that fuel is humans (and stones for some reason.)

Surah 3:12

> [Prophet], say to the disbelievers, ‘You will be defeated and driven together into Hell, a foul resting place.

Verses like these shows te heart of Allah. Allah hates people. Yehovah, the God of the Bible, loves people and wants to see everyone saved and come back to him. (2 Peter 3:9) Meanwhile Allah is frothing at the mouth at the opportunity to "defeat" and fry some unbelievers.

###### 13

Surah 3:13

> Already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met [in combat at Badr] - one fighting in the cause of Allāh and another of disbelievers. They saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [their] eyesight.[1] But **Allāh supports with His victory whom He wills**. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision.

This verse shows what kind of god Allah is: A warlike god. And his support is shown through victory in battle. Muslims would do well in taking notice of this. Because for decades there has been an ongoing conflict between two gods in the Middle East. 

On the one hand there is Yehovah, the God of the Jews. Even though the Jews have been less than faithful, Yehovah is faithful to Abraham to not only bring back his descendants from exile *twice*, a feat no other nation has ever even managed *once*, but also to continually defend them against tens of concurrent enemies constantly attacking them. 

On the other hand, you have the Islamic Allah, who is represented by the nations surrounding Israel, and who have been unceasingly harassing, attaching, betraying, and warring against them, (as per standard Islamic behavior.) Yet decade after decade, none of them has been able to defeat Israel, but are constantly defeated themselves.

If **Allāh supports with His victory whom He wills**, then it is quite obvious that Allah is not on the side of the Muslims in this conflict. Or Allah is a weak, inferior god compared to Yehovah.

Surah 3:13,14

> The love of desirable things is made alluring for men- women, children, gold and silver treasures piled up high, horses with fine markings, livestock, and farmland- these may be the joys of this life, but God has the best place to return to. [Prophet], say, ‘Would you like me to tell you of things that are better than all of these? Their Lord will give those who are mindful of God Gardens graced with flowing streams, where they will stay with pure spouses and God’s good pleasure- God is fully aware of His servants

This passage offers us a glimpse of the Islamic paradise. On earth there are earthly pleasures, like having family, riches, and land. In paradise there are also earthly pleasures, like having family, and land. Paradise has cattle and gold, and the farmland is replaced by gardens, but the same physical desires are present.

The way Jesus described heaven in Luke 20:36 is that we will be like angels, not marrying, which implies that the pleasure of sex is replaced by something better, the pleasure of being with god.

In the Islamic paradise, people will still be married and have sex. So it's a vision of the perfect condition that still caters to fleshly desires, and is attractive to carnal, unspiritual people.

Surah 3:15,16 

> [Those] who pray, “Our Lord! We have believed, so forgive our sins and protect us from the torment of the Fire.” ˹It is they˺ who are patient, sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness before dawn.

Here we see an example of how Islam is a works righteousness religion. That means that it teaches that in order to gain God's approval, you must do a bunch of stuff and jump through hoops, as if God could be paid off or bribed. Here specifically, charity and prayer are important payments to Allah to earn paradise. It doesn't tell you how much you must pay to be accepted, leaving you in a perpetual anxious state of uncertainty.

Charity in Islam is not like charity in Christianity. In Christianity you are charitable because your goodwill compels you to serve others. In Islam, you are forced to give charity whether you like it or not, rendering it meaningless.

The Clear Quran adds the note: "Optional prayers before dawn are recommended and are more likely to be accepted." This shows that Allah likes it extra much when life is inconvenient for Muslims.

Surah 3:18

> Allah bears witness that there is no god but He

To become a Muslim you must take the "shahada", the confession of faith, which is that "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger."

In this verse, Allah himself confessed half of the shahada. 

In Surah 33:45 Allah also says:

> O prophet, We have sent you as a witness and as a bearer of good news and a warner,

Which is basically the last part.

So from this we can conclude that Allah is a Muslim.

###### 19

Surah 3:19

> The true religion with Allah is Islam. ...But whoever rejects the verses of Allah, then Allah is swift in reckoning.

A common problem with Islam is that they just believe things based on the [Ipse dixit fallacy](/quran/topics/ipse-dixit), which is basically a fancy word for "trust me bro". The Quran gives no reason or evidence for it's claim, neither do most Muslims. Logic is haram. 

Christianity is based on logic and reason. Christians must test everything and argue for their fairy, because their faith is true. In Islam, logic and reason is discouraged and Muslims don't question Islam, they just accept unfounded claims like this without questioning.

Those who were given the Scripture did not dispute except after the knowledge had come to them, out of mutual envy and rivalry.
