## Allah's fatherhood

### Jews and Christians have a familial relationship with God

Surah 5:18

> The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!”

The Quran admits Jews and Christians consider God to be their father. 


### Allah is not a father

Surah 112:4; 18:4; 19:35, 88-93

> He neither begets nor is born,

> It warns those people who assert, ‘God has offspring.’

> it would not befit God to have a child. He is far above that: when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be,’ and it is.

> The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’ How terrible is this thing you assert: it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces,that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy. It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring]: there is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant-

You can never have a close relationship with the god of Islam as a child to a father, you can only be a slave to a master. If this is true, then the universe is bleak indeed. 

### The best Muslims can hope for us to be slaves

Surah 19:88-93

> They say, “The All-Merciful (Allah) has got a son.”… they have ascribed a son to the All-Merciful (Allah), while it does not behove the All-Merciful to have a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth, but bound to come to the All-Merciful as a slave.


### Allah would need a wife to become a father

Surah 6:101

> the Creator of the heavens and earth! How could He have children when He has no spouse

Muslims believe that the omnipotent one would need to have literal sex with a literal spouse in order to produce offspring. Laughable.

At the same time Surah 39:4 says:

> God could have chosen any of His creation He willed for offspring

So on the one hand Allah could just "choose" a creation as his offspring, but on the other hand he would need a spouse to produce offspring. Neither of those are correct, [and they contradict.](/islam/errors/#contradictions)

## Allah's Godship 

### Allah is unlike anything else

Surah 42:12

> There is nothing like Him, for He ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.

### Allah is not the only creator

Surah 23:14

> So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.

Surah 37:125

> Do you call upon ˹the idol of˺ Ba’l and abandon the Best of Creators—

Allah is only one creator of many. Apparently Ba'l is a competing creator. The other creators are also good, but Allah thinks that he is the best of them.


### Not everyone will bow before Allah

In the Bible, Philippians 2:10-11 it says:

> at the name of Jesus **every knee should bow**, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

However not everyone will be able to bow before Allah, showing that he is not the same god as the god of the Bible, and also is not worthy.

Surah 68:42

> On the Day when matters become dire, they will be invited to prostrate themselves but will be prevented from doing so

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4919](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4919)

> Such people will try to prostrate (on the Day of Judgment) but their back swill be as stiff as if it is one bone


### Allah is unable to receive prayers at certain times 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 582, 583](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:582)

> Allah's Messenger said, 'Do not pray at the time of sunrise and at the time of sunset.' " Ibn Umar said, "Allah's Messenger said, 'If the edge of the sun appears (above the horizon) delay the prayer till it becomes high, and if the edge of the sun disappears, delay the prayer till it sets (disappears completely).'

It seems Allah is unable to receive prayers when the earth and sun are at a specific angle with one another. Perhaps the position of the sun affects the reception? Or is his Office closed during those hours? And how does that work, since the sun is rising or setting somewhere in the world all the time?



## Allah's personality traits

### Allah is a narcissist {#narcissist}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4634](http://web.archive.org/web/20221005220613/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4634)

> And none loves to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason He praises Himself.

### Allah is afraid of insults {#insults}

Surah 6:108

> Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance.

Allah doesn't like it when people insult him, because [Allah is a narcissist](#narcissist). But this verse also gives non-Muslims the right to insult Allah if Muslims are being disrespectful and insulting them.

### Allah is a liar

Surah 8:43-44

> Recall: Allah showing them to you in your sleep as few, for had He showed them to you as many, you would have faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter, but Allah saved (the situation). He is indeed All-Knowing of what lies within the chests. And recall: when you met, Him showing them to you as few in your eyes and making you appear fewer in their eyes, so that Allah might carry out a predetermined matter. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Allah deceived Muhammad to go into battle against a large army, making him think it was a small army. He also deceived his enemies in the same way.

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

Allah deceived the Jews and Romans into thinking they killed Jesus. Allah is deceptive.

This is also a verse that proves Islam is historically false, for contrathe crucifixion of Jesus is the most well documented event in ancient history.](satan/islam/errors/#no-crucifixion)

Surah 3:54

### Allah leads people astray

Surah 16:93

> Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills. And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do.


### Allah blinds people to the truth

Surah 2:7

> Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their sight is a veil; for for them is a great punishment.

It is Allah's fault if someone does not believe.

## Allah hates deaf and dumb people

Surah 8:22

> Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allāh are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason

### Allah wants people to sin

[Sahih Muslim 2749](http://web.archive.org/web/20240115142947/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2749)

> By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them.

If people didn't sin, Allah would wipe them out and replace them with people who would sin. 

Who is it that wants people to sin? God, or Satan?

### Allah has predestined adultery

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6612](http://web.archive.org/web/20240208033843/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6612)

> Allah has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://web.archive.org/web/20240325212822/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

### Allah wants contention

Surah 2:253

> Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.

Disagreements and fights between religious factions is Allah's will. He wants people to be divided and fighting.

### Allah tortures the dead if their relatives grieve

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://web.archive.org/web/20230928004431/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.

### Allah is a fickle and arbitrary judge

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2599](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2599)

> "Indeed two men among those who entered the Fire will be screaming violently.  So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say: 'Take them out.'  Then when they are taken out He will say: 'What caused you to scream so violently?'

Is Allah stupid or just cruel?

> They will say: 'We did that so You would have mercy on us.' He will say: 'My mercy for you is that you both go and throw yourselves where you were in the Fire.' 

How is it mercy to tell someone to throw themselves into hellfire? Seems like something Saw would do.

> So they will go. One of them will throw himself in, and He will make it cool and peaceful for him. 

How is it justice to randomly make hell comfortable for a sinner? Allah is not consistent at all.

> And the other will stand there and not throw himself in, so the Lord, Mighty and Majestic, will say to him: 'What prevented you from throwing yourself in as your companion did?' He will say: 'O Lord! I hope that you will not return me to it after You have taken me out.' 

Understandable. This guy doesn't play Allah's manipulative games.

> So the Lord, Blessed and Exalted, will say to him: 'For you is what you hoped for,' and so they will both enter Paradise together by the mercy of Allah."

So he is pardoned for not accepting Allahs "mercy" of throwing himself into hell? And the other guy was also taken with him to paradise? Allah has proven to be neither merciful, nor just, nor consistent, but fickle and arbitrary and completely illogical.

### Allah admits that he is Satan

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4950](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4950)

> Once Allah's Messenger became sick and could not offer his night prayer (Tahajjud) for two or three nights. Then a lady (the wife of Abu Lahab) came and said, "O Muhammad! I think that **your Satan has forsaken you**, for I have not seen him with you for two or three nights!" On that Allah revealed: 'By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens, **your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither forsaken you**, nor hated you.' (93.1-3)

## Allah's religion

### Allah is a muslim

Muslims need to take the Shahada, meaning they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is his prophet.

Surah 3:18

> Allah bears witness that there is no god but He.

Surah 48:29

> Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. 

So since Allah testifies that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is his prophet, it technically means that Allah is a Muslim.


### Allah swears by creation

**Significance of oaths** 

Swearing is a social and psychological act where a person invokes something **greater** or **more sacred** than themselves to lend credibility to their words or promises. People swear on entities like deities, sacred texts, or natural phenomena because these are seen as powerful, eternal, or morally authoritative, capable of witnessing or enforcing the oath. This reflects a universal human tendency to appeal to higher values or powers for accountability. The choice of what is sworn upon reveals both the cultural significance of that entity and the individual’s perceived relationship to it, emphasizing trust, reverence, or honor.

In the Bible, Yahweh swears on himself, because there is nothing higher or more sacred than him. (Genesis 22:16; Isaiah 45:23; Hebrews 6:13) In the Islamic sources, Allah sometimes swears by created things or other deities and is thus showing that he is not the highest and most sacred, but considers himself lower and less sacred than these things.

### Allah swears by the moon

Surah 73:32-34

> But no! By the moon, and the night as it retreats, and the day as it breaks!

In these verses, Allah swears by the moon. This is why this is significant:

In pre-Islamic Arabia, **the moon** was significant in religion and culture, often associated with deities like **Sīn** (or **Wadd**) and linked to fertility, timekeeping, and navigation.

So in this verse, Allah invokes the authority of the moon god Sīn as a greater, more sacred, powerful, and morally authoritative deity, capable of witnessing and enforcing the oath.

This tells us that:

- Allah is not Yahweh.
- Allah is not the highest deity.
- Allah considers other things more sacred and authoritative.
- Allah is a lesser deity than the moon god Sīn.

### Allah swears by the fore-noon and night

Surah 93:1-3

> By the morning sunlight and the night when it falls still! Your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ has not abandoned you, nor has He become hateful ˹of you˺.

Allah swears by the morning and evening because these are more sacred than he is.


### Allah swears by the Lord of the East and West

Surah 70:40

> I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power

Why would Allah swear by someone else? A Lord at that? That only means this Lord is higher than Allah. 

Yahweh in the Bible swear by himself because there is no one higher. (Genesis 22:16; Isaiah 45:23; Hebrews 6:13) The Bible shows that the Lord of the east and west is Yahweh. (Malachi 1:11; Psalm 113:3; Isaiah 59:19) So Allah swears by Yahweh.


### Allah prays

Surah 2:157

> Upon those are the prayers *from* their Lord, and mercy; and those are they (who) are the right-guided.

[Quran 33:43, 56 Palmer](https://web.archive.org/web/20240509045448/https://sacred-texts.com/isl/sbe09/033.htm)

> He it is who prays for you and His angels too, to bring you forth out of the darkness into the light, for He is merciful to the believers. …  Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray for him and salute him with a salutation!

[Al Adan Al Mufrad 645](https://web.archive.org/web/20240318170959/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> [Muhammad] said, "If anyone prays once on me, Allah will pray ten times on him.'"

Whom is Allah praying to?




## Allah's mental abilities

### Allah wonders 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3010](https://web.archive.org/web/20240318170959/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3010)

> The Prophet said, "Allah wonders at those people who will enter Paradise in chains."

Apparently there are things that surprise Allah. How could someone supposedly all-knowing wonder about anything?

### Allah can not count

Surah 6:143

> ˹Allah has created˺ four pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats

One pair of sheep and one pair of goats equals four pairs?

### Allah is ignorant {#ignorant}

There are things that Allah does not know unless he investigates, such as who are his believers or not.

Surah 57:25

> And We sent down iron, wherein there is awesome power and many benefits for people, **so that Allah may know** who, without even having seen Him, helps Him and His Messengers.

Surah 5:94

> Allah shall certainly test you with some of the game coming in the range of your hands and spears, so that Allah **may know** those who fear Him

Surah 3:140,166

> so that Allah **may know** those who believe
> was by permission of Allah; **that He might know** the true believers



## Allah's Throne


### The Throne of Allah ejaculates semen 

[Al-Mustadrak ala al-Sahihayn 8397](https://islamweb-net.translate.goog/ar/library/index.php?page=bookcontents&flag=1&bk_no=74&ID=8397&_x_tr_sl=ar&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
> He said: “Then Allah will send water from beneath the Throne like the semen of men, and their flesh and bodies will grow from That water, as the earth grows from the dust.”

### Allah is limited to one location {#not-omnipresent}

Surah 20:5

> the Most Compassionate, Who is˺ established on the Throne.

Allah sits on a throne in heaven.

### Allah's throne is upon water {#allah-water-throne}


[Sahih al-Bukhari 7419](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119045204/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7419)

> His Throne is over the water 

See also: 

- [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3045](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3045)
- [The throne of Satan is upon the water](/islam/vip/#satan-water-throne)

### Allah's throne can be shaken by human affairs {#shaking-throne}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3803](https://web.archive.org/web/20230916231756/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3803)

> I heard the Prophet saying, "The Throne of Allah shook at the death of Sa`d bin Mu`adh."

- [Sahih Muslim 2466 b](https://web.archive.org/web/20231210111632/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2466b)

## Allah is manifested

### Allah manifests himself to creation

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 1485](https://sunnah.com/nasai:1485)

> When Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, manifests Himself to anything of His creation, it humbles itself before Him

### Allah comes down every night {#nightly-visits}

[Sahih Muslim 758b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:758b)

> Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the first part of the night is over (3 am) and says: I am the Lord; I am the Lord: who is there to supplicate Me so that I answer him? Who is there to beg of Me so that I grant him? Who is there to beg forgiveness from Me so that I forgive him? He continues like this till the day breaks.

Allah doesn't know how time zones work. If he comes down every night at 3am, and leave at daybreak, in what time zone is he? It would mean that in one time zone he is descending while in another time zone he is ascending, at the same time. Therefore Allah is always somewhere in our atmosphere at all times, yet he is unable to enter our world, and he is [also located on his throne?](/islam/allah/#not-omnipresent) How does it work?



### Allah is visible 

[Mishkat al-Masabih 725 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:725) 

> I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form…

## Allah has body parts

### Allah has hands

[Mishkat al-Masabih 725 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:725) 

> He placed the palm of His hand between my shoulder-blades and I felt the coolness of it between my nipples!

> I saw my Lord in the most beautiful form…

### Allah shakes hands

[Sunan Ibn Majah 104](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:104)

> The Messenger of Allah said: 'The first person with whom Allah will shake hands will be 'Umar...

This means Allah has physical hands the size of human hands with which he can shake hands with humans. How embarrassing for Muhammad himself that someone else gets to shake hands with Allah before him.

### How many hands does Allah have?

Allah seems to have at least three hands, one left hand and two right hands.

#### Allah has a right and left hand

[Sahih Muslim 2788 a](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607232830/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2788a)

> Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would fold the Heavens on the Day of Judgment and then He would place them on *His right hand* and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)? He would fold the' earth (placing it) on *the left hand* and say: I am the Lord; where are the haughty and where are the proud (today)?

#### Allah also has two right hands

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 5379](https://web.archive.org/web/20221217224642/https://sunnah.com/nasai:5379)

> The Prophet said: "Those who are just and fair will be with Allah, Most High, on thrones of light, at the right hand of the Most Merciful, those who are just in their rulings and in their dealings with their families and those of whom they are in charge." Muhammad said in his Hadith: "And both of His hands are right hands."

### Allah has a face

Surah 55:27

> all that remains is the Face of your Lord

### Allah has eyes

Surah 20:39

> ...you should be reared under My watchful eye

[Sahih Muslim 2933 a](https://web.archive.org/web/20240222220738/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2933a)

> your Lord is not one-eyed


### Allah has a shin

Surah 68:42

> Beware of the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared, and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so,

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4919](https://web.archive.org/web/20230125022013/https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4919)

> Our Lord Allah will lay bare His Shin


### Allah has a foot

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4848](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4848)

> Allah puts His Foot over [hellfire]

### Allah was grabbed by the balls

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4830](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4830)

> Allah created His creation, and when He had finished it, the womb, got up and caught hold of [the loin of] Allah …

The translation hides the meaning of the Arabic, which says that the womb caught hold of the "حَقْوِ" (haqw) of Allah. Haqw means loin or groin area. 
This not only means that Allah has a genital area but also that he was sexually assaulted by a cunt.

## Allah's economy

### Allah needs your money

Surah 2:254

> Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. 

Give him your money before it's too late!

### Allah inherits

Surah 57:10

> And why should you not spend in the cause of Allah, while Allah is the inheritor of the heavens and the earth?
