Claim: Rebekah was 3 years old when she married Isaac.

Why it’s false:

This comes from a misuse of a Jewish midrashic interpretation that was never intended as literal history. The biblical text itself gives no age for Rebekah but describes her as a young woman (Heb. naʿarah), a word never used for toddlers. The narrative shows her performing adult tasks (drawing water for a caravan), unambiguously indicating maturity.

# Just a distraction from Muhammad's pedophilia

The claim that Rebecca in the Bible was married off to Isaac at the age of 3 is made to justify the fact that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6 and consummated the marriage when she was 9.[^hadiths]

[^hadiths]: See [Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130), [3896](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3896), [5133](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5133), [5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134), [5158](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5158), [Sahih Muslim 1422c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c), [1422b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422b), [1876](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1876), [1982](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1982), [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4931](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4931), [2121](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121), and [Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378).

What a sinful person in the Bible did or did not do is irellevant, since Christians do not follow Isaac or any other sinful person, but follow the sinless Jesus. Muslims however do follow a sinful pedophile as their moral example.

# Muslims bring it up because they know that pedophilia evil

If Rebecca was married at 3 years old, do you personally think that Isaac was a good moral example?

If you are ok with middle aged men marrying little girls, then why would you even try to defend Muhammad by bringing up Isaac? If pedophilia is good according to you, why even try to deflect? If you were truly ok with it, you wouldn’t feel the need to even say anything.

If Isaac was a morally despicable man for allegedly marrying Rebecca at age 3, why would you use him to justify that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6, and had sex with her at age 9? 

That only shows that you think Muhammad is comparable to the most despicable man in the Bible. The only reason for you to do this is because you know that what Muhammad did was morally evil, but you must hypocritically defend him.

# Christians do not follow Isaac

If Isaac married Rebecca at age 3, Christians would condemn him as the worst and most sinful human in recorded history, much like Muhammad.

If Isaac was a pedophile like Muhammad was, Christians still do not follow the moral example of Isaac, but of Jesus. 

# Rebecca was an adult 

There is not a single verse in the Bible that gives the age of Rebecca at marriage. - The Bible says she was a woman of marriageable age.
- The Bible describes her as a young woman (Heb. naʿarah), a word never used for toddlers. 
- She performs adult tasks that children would not be doing. 
- She was strong enough to haul several thousand liters of water. No toddler is capable of this. 
- She was mature enough to make major life decisions. No toddler would be allowed to do this.
