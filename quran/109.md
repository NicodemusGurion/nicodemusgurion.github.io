> <span id="v1">1</span> Say: O disbelievers!

> <span id="v3">3</span> Nor worship you that which I worship.
> <span id="v4">4</span> And I shall not worship that which you worship.

Thus Surah, especially verse 6, is one that Muslims cherry pick to try to frame Islam as tolerant. It's important to knowcthe context that it was written during the Meccan period, when Muhammad had not yet been thrown out of Mecca. At that time his group was small and just tried to fly under the radar and appeal to liberal ideas of freedom of religion. However after he was thrown out, Islam was turned into a world conquering violent political movement. 

Even today Muslims follow the same pattern. When outnumbered they feign support for liberal freedom of religion ideas, to protectcthrmselves. But asxsoon as they become politically dominant, they start implementing Islamic tyranny.
