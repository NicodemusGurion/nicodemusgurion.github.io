| <span id="v1" data-verse="56:1" data-tags="">1</span> | When the event befalleth - | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="56:2" data-tags="">2</span> | There is no denying that it will befall - | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="56:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Abasing (some), exalting (others); | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="56:4" data-tags="">4</span> | When the earth is shaken with a shock | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="56:5" data-tags="">5</span> | And the hills are ground to powder | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="56:6" data-tags="">6</span> | So that they become a scattered dust, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="56:7" data-tags="">7</span> | And ye will be three kinds: | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="56:8" data-tags="">8</span> | (First) those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="56:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And (then) those on the left hand; what of those on the left hand ? | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="56:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And the foremost in the race, the foremost in the race: | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="56:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Those are they who will be brought nigh | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="56:12" data-tags="">12</span> | In gardens of delight; | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="56:13" data-tags="">13</span> | A multitude of those of old | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="56:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And a few of those of later time. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="56:15" data-tags="">15</span> | On lined couches, | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="56:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Reclining therein face to face. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="56:17" data-tags="">17</span> | There wait on them immortal youths | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="56:18" data-tags="">18</span> | With bowls and ewers and a cup from a pure spring | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="56:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Wherefrom they get no aching of the head nor any madness, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="56:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And fruit that they prefer | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="56:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And flesh of fowls that they desire. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="56:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And (there are) fair ones with wide, lovely eyes, | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="56:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Like unto hidden pearls, | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="56:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Reward for what they used to do. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="56:25" data-tags="">25</span> | There hear they no vain speaking nor recrimination | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="56:26" data-tags="">26</span> | (Naught) but the saying: Peace, (and again) Peace. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="56:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And those on the right hand; what of those on the right hand ? | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="56:28" data-tags="">28</span> | Among thornless lote-trees | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="56:29" data-tags="">29</span> | And clustered plantains, | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="56:30" data-tags="">30</span> | And spreading shade, | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="56:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And water gushing, | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="56:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And fruit in plenty | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="56:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Neither out of reach nor yet forbidden, | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="56:34" data-tags="">34</span> | And raised couches; | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="56:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Lo! We have created them a (new) creation | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="56:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And made them virgins, | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="56:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Lovers, friends, | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="56:38" data-tags="">38</span> | For those on the right hand; | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="56:39" data-tags="">39</span> | A multitude of those of old | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="56:40" data-tags="">40</span> | And a multitude of those of later time. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="56:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And those on the left hand: What of those on the left hand ? | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="56:42" data-tags="">42</span> | In scorching wind and scalding water | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="56:43" data-tags="">43</span> | And shadow of black smoke, | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="56:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Neither cool nor refreshing. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="56:45" data-tags="">45</span> | Lo! heretofore they were effete with luxury | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="56:46" data-tags="">46</span> | And used to persist in the awful sin. | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="56:47" data-tags="">47</span> | And they used to say: When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again, | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="56:48" data-tags="">48</span> | And also our forefathers ? | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="56:49" data-tags="">49</span> | Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Lo! those of old and those of later time | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="56:50" data-tags="">50</span> | Will all be brought together to the tryst of an appointed day. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="56:51" data-tags="">51</span> | Then lo! ye, the erring, the deniers, | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="56:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Ye verily will eat of a tree called Zaqqum | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="56:53" data-tags="">53</span> | And will fill your bellies therewith; | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="56:54" data-tags="">54</span> | And thereon ye will drink of boiling water, | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="56:55" data-tags="">55</span> | Drinking even as the camel drinketh. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="56:56" data-tags="">56</span> | This will be their welcome on the Day of Judgment. | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="56:57" data-tags="">57</span> | We created you. Will ye then admit the truth ? | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="56:58" data-tags="">58</span> | Have ye seen that which ye emit ? | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="56:59" data-tags="">59</span> | Do ye create it or are We the Creator ? | |
| <span id="v60" data-verse="56:60" data-tags="">60</span> | We mete out death among you, and We are not to be outrun, | |
| <span id="v61" data-verse="56:61" data-tags="">61</span> | That We may transfigure you and make you what ye know not. | |
| <span id="v62" data-verse="56:62" data-tags="">62</span> | And verily ye know the first creation. Why, then, do ye not reflect ? | |
| <span id="v63" data-verse="56:63" data-tags="">63</span> | Have ye seen that which ye cultivate ? | |
| <span id="v64" data-verse="56:64" data-tags="">64</span> | Is it ye who foster it, or are We the Fosterer ? | |
| <span id="v65" data-verse="56:65" data-tags="">65</span> | If We willed, We verily could make it chaff, then would ye cease not to exclaim: | |
| <span id="v66" data-verse="56:66" data-tags="">66</span> | Lo! we are laden with debt! | |
| <span id="v67" data-verse="56:67" data-tags="">67</span> | Nay, but we are deprived! | |
| <span id="v68" data-verse="56:68" data-tags="">68</span> | Have ye observed the water which ye drink ? | |
| <span id="v69" data-verse="56:69" data-tags="">69</span> | Is it ye who shed it from the raincloud, or are We the Shedder ? | |
| <span id="v70" data-verse="56:70" data-tags="">70</span> | If We willed We verily could make it bitter. Why then, give ye not thanks ? | |
| <span id="v71" data-verse="56:71" data-tags="">71</span> | Have ye observed the fire which ye strike out; | |
| <span id="v72" data-verse="56:72" data-tags="">72</span> | Was it ye who made the tree thereof to grow, or were We the grower ? | |
| <span id="v73" data-verse="56:73" data-tags="">73</span> | We, even We, appointed it a memorial and a comfort for the dwellers in the wilderness. | |
| <span id="v74" data-verse="56:74" data-tags="">74</span> | Therefor (O Muhammad), praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous. | |
| <span id="v75" data-verse="56:75" data-tags="">75</span> | Nay, I swear by the places of the stars - | |
| <span id="v76" data-verse="56:76" data-tags="">76</span> | And lo! that verily is a tremendous oath, if ye but knew - | |
| <span id="v77" data-verse="56:77" data-tags="">77</span> | That (this) is indeed a noble Qur'an | |
| <span id="v78" data-verse="56:78" data-tags="">78</span> | In a Book kept hidden | |
| <span id="v79" data-verse="56:79" data-tags="">79</span> | Which none toucheth save the purified, | |
| <span id="v80" data-verse="56:80" data-tags="">80</span> | A revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v81" data-verse="56:81" data-tags="">81</span> | Is it this Statement that ye scorn, | |
| <span id="v82" data-verse="56:82" data-tags="">82</span> | And make denial thereof your livelihood ? | |
| <span id="v83" data-verse="56:83" data-tags="">83</span> | Why, then, when (the soul) cometh up to the throat (of the dying) | |
| <span id="v84" data-verse="56:84" data-tags="">84</span> | And ye are at that moment looking | |
| <span id="v85" data-verse="56:85" data-tags="">85</span> | - And We are nearer unto him than ye are, but ye see not - | |
| <span id="v86" data-verse="56:86" data-tags="">86</span> | Why then, if ye are not in bondage (unto Us), | |
| <span id="v87" data-verse="56:87" data-tags="">87</span> | Do ye not force it back, if ye are truthful ? | |
| <span id="v88" data-verse="56:88" data-tags="">88</span> | Thus if he is of those brought nigh, | |
| <span id="v89" data-verse="56:89" data-tags="">89</span> | Then breath of life, and plenty, and a Garden of delight. | |
| <span id="v90" data-verse="56:90" data-tags="">90</span> | And if he is of those on the right hand, | |
| <span id="v91" data-verse="56:91" data-tags="">91</span> | Then (the greeting) "Peace be unto thee" from those on the right hand. | |
| <span id="v92" data-verse="56:92" data-tags="">92</span> | But if he is of the rejecters, the erring, | |
| <span id="v93" data-verse="56:93" data-tags="">93</span> | Then the welcome will be boiling water | |
| <span id="v94" data-verse="56:94" data-tags="">94</span> | And roasting at hell-fire. | |
| <span id="v95" data-verse="56:95" data-tags="">95</span> | Lo! this is certain truth. | |
| <span id="v96" data-verse="56:96" data-tags="">96</span> | Therefor (O Muhammad) praise the name of thy Lord, the Tremendous. | |
