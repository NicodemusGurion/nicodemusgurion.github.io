Claim: The Bible has been corrupted and is not the original revelation


Why it’s false:

Textual criticism (Christian, Jewish, secular, and even many Muslim scholars) affirms the remarkable stability of the biblical manuscripts.

- The New Testament is the best-attested text of the ancient world.
- The Dead Sea Scrolls show the Old Testament text was stable centuries before Christ. The “tahrif” concept in early Islam originally meant misinterpretation, not textual corruption.
