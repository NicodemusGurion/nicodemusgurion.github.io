title: The Bible has contradictions
search: true
---

Claim: There are thousands of Bible contradictions; therefore it cannot be God’s Word.

Why it’s misleading:

Lists circulated online often rely on:
- Ignoring genre (e.g., parable vs. narrative)
- Misunderstanding ancient historiography
- Translation issues
- Citation-style differences (ancient authors did not use modern quotation conventions)

Most alleged contradictions dissolve under careful exegesis.
