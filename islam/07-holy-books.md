# The Bible 

**Note:** Muhammad was an ignoramus and did not know anything about the Bible, so when he refers to the Torah he means the Old Testament, and when he refers to the Gospel he means the New Testament.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#bible-confirmed}

Surah 2:41

> And believe in what I have sent down (i.e. the Quran) confirming that which is with you (i.e. the Bible), and be not the first to disbelieve in it.

Surah 2:91

> When it is said to them, ‘Believe in God’s revelations,’ they reply, ‘We believe in what was revealed to us,’ but they do not believe in what came afterwards (i.e. the Quran), though it is the truth confirming what they already have (i.e. the Bible).

Surah 2:101

> Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.

Surah 3:3

> He has sent down upon you the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel

See also Surah 2:4,41,89,91,97,101,111;3:3-4,23,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,48,66,68;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,48,105;26:196;28:48-49;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19

## The Torah is the word of Allah

Surah 5:43,44

> But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers. Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. 

Also: Surah 32:23

See: [No one can change the word of Allah](#unchanging-word)

## The Quran says the Gospel confirms the Torah 

Surah 5:46

> Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

## The Quran confirms the Bible {#confirms-bible}

Surah 2: 88-91

> And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, **confirming what is with them**… When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides, even if it be Truth **confirming what is with them**…

The Quran says that it confirms "what is with them", referring to the scriptures that the Jews and Christians had in the 7th century. So according to the Quran the 7th century Bible is confirmed as authentic, uncorrupted and coming from Allah. [The problem for the liars claiming that the Bible is corrupted is that we have extant copies that are even 300](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Sinaiticus)-[900 years older than the Quran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls), and they are identical to our modern Bibles. As are all extant books and manuscripts from the 5th, 6th, 7th century and so on, showing that there has been absolutely no corruption of the meaning. This disproves the idea some Muslims put forth that the Bible has been corrupted.

## Christians and Jews must observe the Bible

Surah 5:68

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” 

"People of the book" are Christians and Jews. They must observe the Torah (Old Testament) and gospel (New Testament), because these are revealed by God.

Would Allah order people to observe corrupted books? Obviously not. So these books can not be corrupted.


## Christians must judge by the gospel

Surah 5:47

> So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.


## Muhammad is ordered to consult the Jews and Christians if he is in doubt

Surah 10:94

>  If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,


## Muhammad says the Jews and Christians do have the Torah and Gospel 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2653](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2653)


> He [Muhammad] said: … The Tawrah and Injil are with the Jews and Christians, but what do they avail of them?

Muhammed is saying that the Jews and Christian's of his day **did** have the Torah and gospel. Which proves that it had not been "corrupted" in those days.

And since we have complete Bibles hundreds of years older than Islam, and these Bibles are identical to modern ones (since we use them to translate the modern ones), then the Torah and gospels that we have today are the exact same that Muhammad said existed in his days.

# The Quran {#quran}

See also [the Bible](#bible).

## Clear and unclear

Surah 3:7 says that in the Quran "some verses are precise…while others are elusive." Meanwhile Surah 11:1 says that the Quran is "a Book whose verses are well perfected and then fully explained. " So which is it? Is it clear or unclear?


## The Quran is only meant for the Arabs

Surah 42:7

> And so We have revealed to you a Quran in Arabic, so you may warn the Mother of Cities1 and everyone around it, and warn of the Day of Gathering—about which there is no doubt—˹when˺ a group will be in Paradise and another in the Blaze.

Surah 14:4

> We have never sent a messenger who did not use his own people’s language to make things clear for them.

## Non-arabs predicted to not believe 

Surah 26:198,199

> And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, and he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it.

Allah is saying that if Muhammad had gone to non-Arabs, they would not believe him. Are non-Arabs not as gullible as Arabs, or what? This is a prediction by Allah that proved to be false, since many non-Arabs have accepted Islam, even from Muhammad directly.


## The original Quranic manuscripts were burned 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4987](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4987)

> ... So Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you."...Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.

We have no way of confirming that the current Quran is uncorrupted or even the same as the message Muhammad delivered.


## The Quran was foretold in the Bible

Surah 26:192-196

> Truly, this Quran has been sent down by the Lord of the Worlds:...This was foretold in the scriptures of earlier religions.

If the Bible was allegedly corrupted, why would Allah not know that it would be? And why would he use a corrupted book to foretell the Quran?

## Proof of inspiration {#proof-of-inspiration}

Surah 2:23-24

> 23 If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down upon Our slave, then produce a chapter like it and call upon your helpers other than Allah, if you are truthful.24 But if you did not do it, and you can never do it; then beware of the Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

The only claim to inspiration the Quran makes is in its literary excellence, claiming no one can produce a chapter like it. But if you have read it the first thing that strikes you is that literary speaking, it is garbage. Even a mediocre poet would be able to write a chapter far more excellent than most chapters of the Quran.

## No one can change the word of Allah {#unchanging-word}


Surah 6:34,115

> The word of your Lord is complete in its truth and justice. No one can change His words: He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing.

Surah 10:64

> Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter - There is no changing the Words of Allah - that is the Supreme Triumph.

Surah 18:27

> And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him.

Surah 50:29

> My Word cannot be changed, nor am I unjust to ˹My˺ creation.”

## The word of Allah CAN be changed

Surah 2:75

> a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it



## The Quran is not perfectly preserved {#not-preserved}

One miraculous claim made is that the Quran has been perfectly preserved. However the Quran and Hadiths contradict this.

### Allah foretold that the Quran wouldn’t be perfectly preserved {#no-preservation}

Surah 2:106

> If We ever abrogate a verse or **cause it to be forgotten**, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?

### The Quran was corrupted even during Muhammad's lifetime {#early-corruption}


[Sahih al-Bukhari 2410](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2410)

> Narrated Abdullah: I heard a man reciting a verse (of the Holy Qur'an) but I had heard the Prophet reciting it differently. So, I caught hold of the man by the hand and took him to Allah's Messenger who said, "Both of you are right."


### Two chapters of the Quran were forgotten {#surahs-forgotten}

[Sahih Muslim 1050](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1050)

> Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad… We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. **I have, however, forgotten it** with the exception of this which I remember out of it:" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust." And we used so recite a surah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and **I have forgotten it**, but remember (this much) out of it:" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise" and" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection"

This reciter admits that they **used to recite** two surahs meaning it was once part of the Quran, but that they just forgot them. He remembers some fragments, but these match nothin in the Quran, proving that these surahs are gone forever. This proves the Quran has not been perfectly preserved.

### Even Muhammad forgot what the Quran said

[Sahih al Bukhari 5038](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5038)

> Narrated Aisha: Allah's Messenger heard a man reciting the Qur'an at night, and said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has reminded me of such-and-such Verses of such-and-such Suras, which I was caused to forget."

Not even the man who made it up could remember it, yet they want me to believe the Quran was perfectly preserved?


### Verses of the Quran were eaten by a sheep {#sheep-ate-verses}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944)

> It was narrated that 'Aishah said “The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow. When the Messenger of Allah died, we were preoccupied with his death, and a tame sheep came in and ate it.”

How can the Quran be perfectly preserved when parts of it were literally eaten by a sheep?


## Chapters of the Quran could be ordered on demand {#surah-on-demand}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4483](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4483)

> I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. 

Apparently, chapters could be requested on demand by the followers of Muhammad to suit their personal preferences. How convenient.



## Denying a Quran verse makes you a kafir {#denying-quran}

Surah 2:85

> Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment?

Surah 4:150

> Surely those who deny Allah and His messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers, saying, “We believe in some and disbelieve in others,” desiring to forge a compromise,


Surah 29:47

> no one rejects Our verses except the infidels.

## Denying a Quran verse is a capital offense {#execute-kafir}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2539](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2539)

> It was narrated from Ibn'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said:
> “Whoever denies a Verse of the Qur'an, it is permissible to strike his neck (i.e., execute him) 

See also [Apostasy](#apostasy)

## Muslims shouldn't bring the Quran to enemy lands

[Sahih Muslim 1869 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1869)

> The Messenger of Allah forbade that one should travel to the land of the enemy taking the Qur'an with him.

## A Christian wrote the Quran

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3617](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3617)

> There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him."

At least part of the Quran was written down by, or edited by a Christian convert to Islam (and later re-convert to Christianity). He claimed to understand it better than Muhammad.


## The Quran is alive and will intercede on judgment day {#quran-intercession}

[Sahih Muslim 804 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:804a)

> Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite It. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqara and Surah Al 'Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them.

Islam teaches that the Quran is actually alive and will function as an intercessor on the day of judgment. It will come as clouds, shades, or flocks of birds, and it will speak, pleading for Muslims.

# Verses where the Quran affirms the Bible

Surah 2:4,41,89,91,97,101;3:3-4,23,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,46,48,66,68;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,105;26:196;28:48-49;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19 

These verses shows that according to the Quran:


- The Quran confirms the Bible.
- The authority of the Quran is based on the reliability of the Bible.
- The Bible (including but not limited to the Torah, Psalms, and Gospels) comes from Allah.
- The Bible was available to Muhammad and his peers.
- The Bible available in Muhammad's day was reliable, unchanged and complete. Since we have the exact same text today, it is still reliable. 
- Jews and Christians are required to observe what is revealed in the Bible.
- The Quran must be double checked by using the Bible.


Nowhere does the Quran even hint that the Bible has been corrupted.

Surah 2:4

> And who believe in (the Qur’ân and the Sunnah )1 which has been sent down (revealed) to you (O Muhammad) and in **that which was sent down before you [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.]** and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter. (Resurrection, recompense of their good and bad deeds, Paradise and Hell).

Surah 2:41

> And believe in what I have sent down (this Qur’ân), confirming that which is with you, [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and buy [get] not with **My Verses [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]** a small price (i.e. getting a small gain by selling My Verses), and fear Me and Me Alone. (Tafsîr At-Tabarî ).

The Bible is the verses of Allah.

Surah 2:89

> And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’ân) from Allâh **confirming what is with them [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]**, although aforetime they had invoked Allâh (for coming of Muhammad) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the Curse of Allâh be on the disbelievers.

Surah 2:91

> And when it is said to them (the Jews), "Believe in what Allâh has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth **confirming what is with them**. Say (O Muhammad to them): "Why then have you killed the Prophets of Allâh aforetime, if you indeed have been believers?"

The Bible was available in Muhammad's day.

Surah 2:91

> Say (O Muhammad): "Whoever is an enemy to Jibrîl (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur’ân) down to your heart by Allâh’s Permission, **confirming what came before it [i.e. the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)]** and guidance and glad tidings for the believers.

Surah 2:101

> And when there came to them a Messenger from Allâh (i.e. Muhammad) **confirming what was with them**, a party of **those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of Allâh behind their backs** as if they did not know!

The Bible is the Book of Allah.

Surah 3:3,4

> It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur’ân) to you (O Muhammad) with truth, **confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), Aforetime, as a guidance to mankind.** And He sent down the criterion [of judgement between right and wrong (this Qur’ân)]. Truly, those who disbelieve in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, for them there is a severe torment; and Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.

The Bible is a guidance to mankind.

Surah 3:23

> Have you not seen those who **have been given a portion of the Scripture?** They are being invited to the Book of Allâh to settle their dispute, then a party of them turn away, and they are averse.

Surah 3:81

> And (remember) when Allâh took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: "Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allâh), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) **confirming what is with you;** you must, then, believe in him and help him." Allâh said: "Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this)."


Surah 3:93

> All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for himself before the Taurât (Torah) was revealed. Say (O Muhammad): "**Bring here the Taurât (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful."**

The Torah is an authoritative scripture.


Surah 3:184

> Then if they reject you (O Muhammad), so were Messengers rejected before you, who came with Al-Bayyinât (clear signs, proofs, evidence) **and the Scripture and the Book of Enlightenment**

Surah 4:47

> O you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammad) **confirming what is (already) with you**, before We efface faces (by making them like the back of necks; without nose, mouth) and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. And the Commandment of Allâh is always executed.


Surah 5:44

> Verily, **We did send down the Taurât (Torah) [to Mûsâ (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allâh’s Will, judged for the Jews.** And the rabbis and the priests [too judged for the Jews by the Taurât (Torah) after those Prophets], for to them was entrusted the protection of **Allâh’s Book**, and they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear not men but fear Me (O Jews) and **sell not My Verses for a miserable price**. And **whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfirûn** (i.e. disbelievers - of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allâh’s Laws).

They Torah is from Allah, the Quran confirms it, and those who do not judge by it are Kafirs.

Surah 5:45

> And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers

Surah 5:46

> Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, **confirming the Torah revealed before him**. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.

Islam even teaches that Jesus confirmed the previous revelation.

Surah 5:48

> Then We revealed the Book to you (O Muhammad!) with Truth, **confirming whatever of the Book was revealed before, and protecting and guarding over it**. Judge, then, in the affairs of men in accordance with **the Law that Allah has revealed**, and do not follow their desires in disregard of the Truth which has come to you. For each of you We have appointed a Law and a way of life. And had Allah so willed, He would surely have made you one single community; instead, (He gave each of you a Law and a way of life) in order to test you by what He gave you. Vie, then, one with another in good works. Unto Allah is the return of all of you; and He will then make you understand the truth concerning the matters on which you disagreed

The Quran confirms and protects the Bible, which is the Law of Allah.

Surah 5:66

> And had they observed **the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord**, they would have been overwhelmed with provisions from above and below. Some among them are upright, yet many do nothing but evil.


**Surah 5:68**

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “**O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.”** And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve

Jews and Christians are required to observe what is revealed in the Bible.

Surah 6:91,92

> And they have not shown Allah His proper reverence when they said, “Allah has revealed nothing to any human being.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ **“Who then revealed the Book brought forth by Moses as a light and guidance for people**, which you split into separate sheets—revealing some and hiding much? You have been taught ˹through this Quran˺ what neither you nor your forefathers knew.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “**Allah ˹revealed it˺!**” Then leave them to amuse themselves with falsehood. And this (the Qur’ân) is a blessed Book which We have sent down, **confirming (the revelations) which came before it**, so that you may warn the Mother of Towns (i.e. Makkah) and all those around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it (the Qur’ân), and they are constant in guarding their Salât (prayers).

Surah 10:37

> It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, **it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture**. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds.

**Surah 10:94**

> If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then **ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord,** so do not be one of those who doubt,

The Quran must be double checked by using the Bible.


Surah 12:111

> In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather **˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous revelation**, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.

Surah 16:43; 21:7

> And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent revelation, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allâh). **So ask (you, O pagans of Makkah) of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.**

To confirm the Quran, you must consult the Bible.


Surah 20:133

> They say, “Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord?” Has there not come to them the clear sign **of what is contained in the earlier Scriptures?**

Surah 21:105

> And We have written in Zabūr (Psalms) after the advice that the land will be inherited by My righteous slaves.

The Psalms are the words of Allah too.


Surah 26:196

> And it (the Quran) has indeed been ˹foretold˺ in the Scriptures of those before.

The authority of the Quran is based on the reliability of the Bible.

Surah 28:48

> But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Mūsā had been given?” Is it not that they denied what Mūsā had been given before? They said, “Both (Qur’ān and Torah) are works of magic that support each other.” And they said, “We disbelieve each one of them.”

Equating the Quran with the Torah.

Surah 35:25

> If they deny you, so did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, **divine Books, and enlightening Scriptures.**

Surah 35:31

> The Book We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ is the truth, **confirming what came before it.** Surely Allah is All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants.



Surah 37:37

> No: he brought the truth and **confirmed the earlier messengers;**

Surah 40:53

> And indeed, **We gave Moses ˹true˺ guidance, and made the Children of Israel inherit the Scripture**

The scripture of the Jews is the word of Allah.

Surah 46:12

> And before this ˹Quran˺ **the Book of Moses was ˹revealed as˺ a guide and mercy. And this Book is a confirmation, in the Arabic tongue**, to warn those who do wrong, and as good news to those who do good

Surah 46:30

> They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a scripture revealed after Moses, **confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and the Straight Way.**

The Demons want you to follow Islam.

Surah 87:18

> This is certainly ˹mentioned˺ in the earlier Scriptures—the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.

The Quran rests its authority on the Bible.
