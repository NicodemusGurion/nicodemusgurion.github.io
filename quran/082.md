| <span id="v1">1</span> | When the heaven is cleft asunder, | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | When the planets are dispersed, | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | When the seas are poured forth, | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | And the sepulchres are overturned, | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | A soul will know what it hath sent before (it) and what left behind. | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | O man! What hath made thee careless concerning thy Lord, the Bountiful, | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | Who created thee, then fashioned, then proportioned thee ? | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | Into whatsoever form He will, He casteth thee. | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | Nay, but ye deny the Judgment. | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | Lo! there are above you guardians, | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | Generous and recording, | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | Who know (all) that ye do. | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | Lo! the righteous verily will be in delight. | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | And lo! the wicked verily will be in hell; | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | They will burn therein on the Day of Judgment, | |
| <span id="v16">16</span> | And will not be absent thence. | |
| <span id="v17">17</span> | Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Day of Judgment is! | |
| <span id="v18">18</span> | Again, what will convey unto thee what the Day of Judgment is! | |
| <span id="v19">19</span> | A day on which no soul hath power at all for any (other) soul. The (absolute) command on that day is Allah's. | |
