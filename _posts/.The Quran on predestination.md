This is a growing list of scriptures from the Quran about **predestination**.

> [2:6](https://quran.com/2/6) As for those who persist in disbelief, it is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe. 

> [2:7](https://quran.com/2/7)Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous punishment

> [2:10](https://quran.com/2/10) There is sickness in their hearts, and Allah ˹only˺ lets their sickness increase. They will suffer a painful punishment for their lies.

Allah determines their destiny.
