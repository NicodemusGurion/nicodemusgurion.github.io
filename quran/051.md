| <span id="v1" data-verse="51:1" data-tags="">1</span> | By those that winnow with a winnowing | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="51:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And those that bear the burden (of the rain) | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="51:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And those that glide with ease (upon the sea) | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="51:4" data-tags="">4</span> | And those who distribute (blessings) by command, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="51:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="51:6" data-tags="">6</span> | And lo! the judgment will indeed befall. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="51:7" data-tags="">7</span> | By the heaven full of paths, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="51:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the truth). | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="51:9" data-tags="">9</span> | He is made to turn away from it who is (himself) averse. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="51:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Accursed be the conjecturers | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="51:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Who are careless in an abyss! | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="51:12" data-tags="">12</span> | They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ? | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="51:13" data-tags="">13</span> | (It is) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="51:14" data-tags="">14</span> | (And it will be said unto them): Taste your torment (which ye inflicted). This is what ye sought to hasten. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="51:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings, | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="51:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers of good; | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="51:17" data-tags="">17</span> | They used to sleep but little of the night, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="51:18" data-tags="">18</span> | And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness, | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="51:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="51:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="51:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see ? | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="51:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised; | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="51:23" data-tags="">23</span> | And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as (it is true) that ye speak. | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="51:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ? | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="51:25" data-tags="">25</span> | When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! (and thought): Folk unknown (to me). | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="51:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf; | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="51:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat ? | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="51:28" data-tags="">28</span> | Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings of (the birth of) a wise son. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="51:29" data-tags="">29</span> | Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A barren old woman! | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="51:30" data-tags="">30</span> | They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="51:31" data-tags="">31</span> | (Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is your errand, O ye sent (from Allah) ? | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="51:32" data-tags="">32</span> | They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk, | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="51:33" data-tags="">33</span> | That we may send upon them stones of clay, | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="51:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction of) the wanton. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="51:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Then we brought forth such believers as were there. | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="51:36" data-tags="">36</span> | But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to Allah). | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="51:37" data-tags="">37</span> | And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="51:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And in Moses (too, there is a portent) when We sent him unto Pharaoh with clear warrant, | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="51:39" data-tags="">39</span> | But he withdrew (confiding) in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="51:40" data-tags="">40</span> | So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was reprobate. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="51:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind against them. | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="51:42" data-tags="">42</span> | It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust. | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="51:43" data-tags="">43</span> | And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take your ease awhile. | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="51:44" data-tags="">44</span> | But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook them even while they gazed; | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="51:45" data-tags="">45</span> | And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves. | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="51:46" data-tags="">46</span> | And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk. | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="51:47" data-tags="">47</span> | We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof). | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="51:48" data-tags="">48</span> | And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)! | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="51:49" data-tags="">49</span> | And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect. | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="51:50" data-tags="">50</span> | Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="51:51" data-tags="">51</span> | And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from Him. | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="51:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A wizard or a madman! | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="51:53" data-tags="">53</span> | Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another ? Nay, but they are froward folk. | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="51:54" data-tags="">54</span> | So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise blameworthy, | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="51:55" data-tags="">55</span> | And warn, for warning profiteth believers. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="51:56" data-tags="">56</span> | I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me. | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="51:57" data-tags="">57</span> | I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me. | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="51:58" data-tags="">58</span> | Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might. | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="51:59" data-tags="">59</span> | And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that day). | |
| <span id="v60" data-verse="51:60" data-tags="">60</span> | And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are promised. | |
