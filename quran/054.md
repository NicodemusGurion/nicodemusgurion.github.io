| <span id="v1" data-verse="54:1" data-tags="">1</span> | The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="54:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion. | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="54:3" data-tags="">3</span> | They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will come to a decision | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="54:4" data-tags="">4</span> | And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should deter, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="54:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="54:6" data-tags="">6</span> | So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner summoneth unto a painful thing. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="54:7" data-tags="">7</span> | With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts spread abroad, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="54:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="54:9" data-tags="">9</span> | The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A madman; and he was repulsed. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="54:10" data-tags="">10</span> | So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="54:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="54:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a predestined purpose. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="54:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="54:14" data-tags="">14</span> | That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was rejected. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="54:15" data-tags="">15</span> | And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="54:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="54:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="54:18" data-tags="">18</span> | (The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="54:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="54:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="54:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="54:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="54:23" data-tags="">23</span> | (The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="54:24" data-tags="">24</span> | For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ? Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="54:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is a rash liar. | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="54:26" data-tags="">26</span> | (Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash liar. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="54:27" data-tags="">27</span> | Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have patience; | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="54:28" data-tags="">28</span> | And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them. Every drinking will be witnessed. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="54:29" data-tags="">29</span> | But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="54:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="54:31" data-tags="">31</span> | Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="54:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="54:33" data-tags="">33</span> | The folk of Lot rejected warnings. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="54:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom We rescued in the last watch of the night, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="54:35" data-tags="">35</span> | As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="54:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the warnings. | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="54:37" data-tags="">37</span> | They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="54:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="54:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Now taste My punishment after My warnings! | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="54:40" data-tags="">40</span> | And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="54:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="54:42" data-tags="">42</span> | Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="54:43" data-tags="">43</span> | Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the scriptures ? | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="54:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Or say they: We are a host victorious ? | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="54:45" data-tags="">45</span> | The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="54:46" data-tags="">46</span> | Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure). | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="54:47" data-tags="">47</span> | Lo! the guilty are in error and madness. | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="54:48" data-tags="">48</span> | On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said unto them): Feel the touch of hell. | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="54:49" data-tags="">49</span> | Lo! We have created every thing by measure. | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="54:50" data-tags="">50</span> | And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an eye. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="54:51" data-tags="">51</span> | And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that remembereth ? | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="54:52" data-tags="">52</span> | And every thing they did is in the scriptures, | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="54:53" data-tags="">53</span> | And every small and great thing is recorded. | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="54:54" data-tags="">54</span> | Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers, | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="54:55" data-tags="">55</span> | Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King. | |
