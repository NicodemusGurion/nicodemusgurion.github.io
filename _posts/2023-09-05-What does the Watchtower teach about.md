# God

What does the Watchtower teach about God?
 
## The name of God, is it Jehovah or Yahweh?

*   ["We do not say that “Jehovah” is the correct pronunciation of God’s name.... for in [the thirteenth century] century the word [Jehovah] historically appears..."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1950881?p=par#h=27)
*   [The New World Bible Translation Committee: ‘Yahwehʹ is the more correct pronunciation.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1960561#h=16)
*   ["It is almost if not quite certain that the Name was originally pronounced ‘Yahweh.’”](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1964521#h=20)
*   [What pronunciation do Jehovah’s witnesses view as more correct? The NWT translators stated that they inclined “to view the pronunciation ‘Yahweh,’ as the more correct way.”](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1964521#h=23)
*   ["Jehovah" means "He is", from "Ahyah" meaning "I am"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952726#h=6)
*   [The hebrew word Haya and Hava means the same thing.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101990063#h=7:111-7:500)
*   [Jehovah's name made up by the Catholics](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1950881?p=par#h=28)
*   ["Jehovah" is the wrong pronunciation](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1950881?p=par#h=27)
*   ["Yahweh" is the correct pronunciation](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1950881?p=par#h=34)
*   ["Yahweh" is the correct pronunciation](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1953649#h=19)
*   ["Yahweh" is closer to the Hebrew](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1980082#h=18)
*   [The name is very important, so let’s not take it seriously](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200028481/3/2)

## God’s omnipresence

*   [God is not omnipresent.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001949#h=11).
*   [God is not omnipresent, but has a body and a location.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981122#h=7:0-9:545).
*   [God's throne is inside the universe.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1969483?p=par#h=3)

# Jesus

What does the Watchtower teach about Jesus, his nature and his role?

## What is the nature of the salvation though Jesus?

*   [By his sacrificial death Jesus Christ bought back or redeemed all the human family who are dying “in Adam.”](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1979448#h=5)
*   [The ransom benefits will only be fully applied after the millenium reign. Until then Jehovah's witnesses has no assurance of salvation.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958081?p=par#h=31) (Christianity teaches that the benefits are applied instantly upon acceptance of the ransom.)

## Does Jesus tell lies?

*   [Jesus deceived the doubtful Thomas by materializing a fake body with fake wound marks in order to "convince" him](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1953641#h=21).
*   [Jesus faked a body with wound marks to deceive his apostles.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000783?p=par#h=8)
*   [Jesus lies to the thief next to him when telling him he will be in paradise with him.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102003056#h=11)

*   [Jesus' body was "disposed of" by Jehovah God, "dissolved into its constituent elements or atoms"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1953641?p=par#h=12).
*   [God caused Jesus body to disappear.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101978160#h=8)

## Should we worship Jesus?

*   [1951: "Make no mistake about this, the true “higher powers” or “superior authorities” to whom Christians are commanded to subject themselves **in worship** are Jehovah God **and Christ Jesus**!"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1951324?p=sen#h=5)
*   [The Watchtower Charter says that its purpose is "public Christian **worship** of the Most High God **and Christ Jesus**."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101978682?p=sen#h=34)
*   [Watchtower charter states: "The purposes of this Society are:...public Christian **worship** of Almighty God **and Christ Jesus**](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1971923#h=34) (The article writers deceptively changes "and" to "[through]" in the quote to hide the original wording, but the original wording can be seen [in this article](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101978682?p=sen#h=34).)
*   [If you are an angel, you **should** worship Jesus.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1954369)

## Who is Jesus mediator for?

*   [Jesus is the “mediator” only for anointed Christians.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1979250#h=4)
*   [The "other sheep" are not in new covenant so Jesus is not their mediator.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1979250#h=5)

# Salvation

## Works righteousness

Are we saved by faith alone or do we have to work to earn our salvation and righteousness?

*   ["We must devote all our time, energy and means to the matter of making this gift of eternal life our own"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952601#h=5)
*   [Salvation requires constant work until the end.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1989681#h=23)

# The Bible

## Bible translation

### The evil scribe conspiracy theory

The Watchtower claims emphatically that the Bible has not been corrupted or changed. They also admit that not a single new testament manuscript contains the name Jehovah. But since that's unacceptable to them, they claim that during the second and third century some conspiracy of evil scribes traveled throughout the ancient world, located every last one of the tens of thousands of available manuscripts, and somehow sneakily replaced the manuscripts with exact copies with the name Jehovah replaced by "Lord", all without anyone ever noticing. Yet they still claim no one has ever been able to change or corrupt the Bible. 

*   [""No ancient Greek manuscript that we possess today of the books from Matthew to Revelation contains God’s name in full.""](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101984305#h=3)
*   ["So, has the Bible been corrupted? Emphatically, no!"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2017210#h=39)
*   [“Sometime during the second or third century C.E. the scribes removed the Tetragrammaton from both the Septuagint and the Christian Greek Scriptures and replaced it with Kyʹri·os, “Lord” or The·osʹ, “God.””](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1001060076#h=7)
*   ["When apostate Christians made copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures, they **evidently** took Jehovah’s personal name out of the text and substituted Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord.”"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2010484#h=8) [^evidently]
*   ["Yielding to that influence [from Satan] translators and copyists—some eagerly, others reluctantly—began to remove God’s own personal name, Jehovah, from his inspired Word in the thousands of places where it appeared. ... It was also taken out of copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1997723#h=16)

[^evidently]: Every time the Watchtower uses the word "evidently" it means that there is absolutely no evidence for it.

### Johannes Greber 

Johannes Greber was a catholic priest who turned into a spiritist. He translated the new testament with the use of demons who would speak through his wife who was a spiritistic medium. Also the demons would sometimes give Johannes Greber visions of what he should write. The Watchtower then used his demon inspired new testament as support for translation choices in the New World Translation.

*   [Johannes Greber "I myself was a Catholic priest, and until I was forty-eight years old had never as much as believed in the possibility of communicating with the world of God’s spirits. The day came, however, when I involuntarily took my first step toward such communication, and experienced things that shook me to the depths of my soul."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1956126#h=12)
*   ["[Greber's] translation was used occasionally in support of renderings of Matthew 27:52, 53 and John 1:1, as given in the New World Translation and other authoritative Bible versions."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1983249?q=Greber&p=par#h=3)
*   ["Similar is the reading by a former Roman Catholic priest [Greber]: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was a god**."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1962682#h=7)

# The Organization

The "Organization", usually indicate the Watchtower corporation along with all its subsidiaries, all congregations of Jehovahs witnesses, and often including the "heavenly part of the organization", the angels.

## The Organization itself

*   [Russel points out that the true congregation is no organization.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993018#h=7)
*   [Russel did not set up an earthly organization.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993018?q=only+organization&p=par#h=9)
*   ["God’s organization is more important to him than the salvation of an immoral or disobedient creature."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1951281?p=par#h=28)
*   [Origin of the use of the term "Organization"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/201995092#h=7)

## Salvation through organization

The Watchtower strongly claims that salvation is only possible through their organization. _Not a Bible teaching._

*   ["Apart from Jehovah’s organization, there is no place else to go for salvation and true joy."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1993685#h=18)
*   ["The witness yet includes the invitation to come to Jehovah’s organization for salvation"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981845#h=23)
*   ["The other sheep should never forget that their salvation depends on their active support of Christ’s anointed “brothers” still on earth."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2012205#h=8)
*   ["A requirement [for salvation] is that we be associated with God’s channel, his organization"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1983124#h=9)
*   ["The provision of salvation is closely connected with Jehovah’s organization... We cannot remain outside the organization of God’s people, separated from it, if we want to have Jehovah’s protection."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1967604#h=6)
*   ["Bible students...must appreciate that identifying themselves with Jehovah’s organization is essential to their salvation."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/201990404)
*   [Only by getting baptized as a Jehovah's witness can you survive Jehovah's day](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2019602#h=36)
*   [Salvation lies in obedience to the faithful slave.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1956848#h=5)

## Being the only Channel of God

The Watchtower claims to be the only "channel" of communication from God. "Channel" in spiritual terms is an spiritistic agent that communicates with the spirit world on behalf of a client. _Not a Bible teaching._

*   ["To them only does Jehovah reveal and ‘show his word’ and its hidden meaning". They're "the one and only channel by which the spirit and understanding are given"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952606#h=7)
*   ["At no time did God use more than one channel or mouthpiece"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958602#h=8) [^mouthpiece]
*   ["That Jehovah is using such a channel today and that it is associated with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses the facts unmistakably show." The organization is the **only** channel.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1962885#h=12)
*   [" Paul shows that ‘Christ is not divided’ and that there were to be no divisions among his followers, we must conclude that **God uses only one channel at any one time**."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1962885#h=11)
*   ["**Never has God had more than one channel of communication at one time**. Failure to recognize and associate with his anointed witnesses would certainly indicate that one is not in Jehovah God’s organization and under his spirit."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1966043)
*   ["Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981889#h=6)
*   ["The Lord would use not many channels for the dissemination of the Truth, but **one channel**."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981926#h=23)
*   ["God was using only one channel to dispense truth"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981926#h=52)
*   ["The anointed Christian remnant among Jehovah’s witnesses today comprise the collective channel of communication"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1955365#h=41)
*   [Only channel](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952606?q=only+channel&p=par#h=7)
*   [God "using his **one** channel."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981926#h=26)
*   ["They do not claim that this slave class is infallible, but they do view it as the one channel that the Lord is using during the last days of this system of things."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993039#h=39)
*   [" Jesus has appointed the ‘faithful slave’ to be the only channel for dispensing spiritual food".](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2016849#h=18)
*   [The organization is equated to God. "It is vital that we appreciate this fact and respond to the directions of the “slave” as we would to the voice of God, because it is His provision."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1957446#h=10)
*   ["We should respond with the same readiness as we would to the voice of God. It is his means of dealing with us now."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1957446#h=28)
*   [The GB receives direction through necromancy](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007006#h=15)
*   [Satan also has a false channel of communication.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1955364#h=29).

This is also what Governing Body member Geoffrey Jackson says under oath when asked about this:

<iframe style="aspect-ration:16/9;width:100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R4-gGWILxEw?si=r3G_wRZshdv2kR3a" title="Geoffrey Jackson admitting they're not the only spokespeople for God." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[^mouthpiece]: If you actually look at the history if God's people in the Bible it is cert rare that Godonly had one prophet on the scene. Most prophets are contemporaries of other prophets.

## The Watchtower being a Prophet

The prophethood of the Watchtower organization is unclear. At times they claim prophethood, at other times they deny it, depending on what is convenient at the time. In any case, anyone who claims to speak directly for God is a prophet no matter what they call themselves. And a prophet who speaks a word that is not from God should be executed. ([Deuteronomy 18:20-22](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bl/r1/lp-e?q=deuteronomy%2018%3A20-22))

*   [1955: "Jehovah’s earthly channel of communication is identified. The earthly channel is either a prophet or a collective prophetlike organization."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1955364#h=24)
*   [1972:"[Jehovah] had a “prophet” to warn them. This “prophet” was not one man, but was a body of men and women. ... they are known as Jehovah’s Christian witnesses."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1972241#h=7)
*   [2010: "God’s people today are **not** prophets."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102010152#h=34)
*   [2014: We are prophets. "Prophesying would apply to any Bible-based teaching that a Christian minister does."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102008084#h=4)
*   [2017: "Anointed Christians share in the work of prophesying. "](https://www.jw.org/en/library/jw-meeting-workbook/october-2017-mwb/meeting-schedule-oct30-nov5/sons-daughters-will-prophesy/)

*   [The Watchtower is apparently using the hegelian dialectic to reach truth, flip-flopping back and forth like a blind person fumbling through darkness.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1981889#h=12)

# The Faithful Slave/Governing Body

The Watchtower teaches that only a small group of men speaks for God and should be trusted implicitly. They call themselves the Governing Body, or the Faithful and Discreet Slave.

## Is the Governing Body inerrant or not?

The Bible says that someone speaking for God, a prophet, must be inerrant[^inerrant], and if they're not inerrant, they don't speak for God and we shouldn't listen to them. ([Deuteronomy 18:20-22](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bl/r1/lp-e?q=deuteronomy%2018%3A20-22)) Their claims on the matter are contradictory:

*   [**They're inerrant:** No doctrinal falsehood is “found in their mouths”.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009123#h=4)
*   [**They're not inerrant**: "The Governing Body is neither inspired nor infallible. Therefore, it can err in doctrinal matters or in organizational direction."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2017283#h=23)
*   [**They're not trustworthy:** "God permits them to make mistakes...Sometimes a truth is seen but then is obscured by a misunderstanding"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1962924#h=27)
*   [**They're not inerrant:** "This magazine [Watchtower] makes no claim of inspiration.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1955365#h=42)"
*   [**They're pointless:** "To say that the Bible is incomplete and that we need to rely also on the unstable thinking of imperfect, uninspired men is to deny the power of God".](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1989327#h=23)

[^inerrant]: **Inerrant:** Never wrong.

## The Faithful Slave

Who really is the Faithful and discreet slave?

*   [Charles T. Russel was the faithful slave](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993039?h=38#h=38)
*   [The Faithful and discreet slave used to be Russel](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993039#h=39)
*   [Russel was considered the faithful slave until 1927](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301975002?q=russell+was+the+faithful+slave&p=par#h=243)
*   ["The composite body of dedicated, anointed footstep followers of Jesus Christ"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958602#h=13)
*   [The faithful and discreet slave is the Governing Body.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102009057#h=20)

# The Anointed

The Watchtower teaches that "anointed" Christians are limited in number to a total of 144.000\. _Not a Bible teaching._ The Bible teaches that all Christians are anointed. The word Christian itself means anointed.

## The call of anointed ended in 1935

*   [1972: "Evidence indicates that by 1934 God’s attention turned to developing the “great crowd”"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1995124#h=10)
*   [1995: "The general gathering of these specially blessed ones ended in 1935"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1995124#h=10)
*   [2007: "The heavenly call ceased in 1935"](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007327#h=5)

Isn't it funny that none of the Governing Body was born on or before 1935? Gerrit Lösch, the oldest member, was born in 1941\. How can they be anointed?

## A steady decline in the number of anointed signals the end is near.

*   [1955: 17000 anointed left](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1955365#h=41)
*   [That "the number of genuine anointed disciples of Christ is dwindling" shows that the end is near.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000042#h=24)
*   ["Only as to Memorial partakers has there been a gradual decline, which is in accord with Scriptural expectations". However recently the jumbers have climbed from about 8.000 to over 20.000.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301981001#h=122)

## But lately the numbers have increased drastically...

When faced with the fact that memorial partakers have started to increase, will thy still say that dwindling numbers mean the end is near? No, they are just going to slander these people by saying they are mentally insane.

*   [New memorial partakers "have mental or emotional problems that lead them to believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven."](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2016046#h=24)

## How many anointed Christians have there ever been?

The Watchtower articles reveal that there have been millions upon millions of anointed Christians throughout history. In the ten persecutions between A.D. 49-313 alone, hundreds of thousands of anointed Christians were killed . The number killed were naturally just a fraction of the total number of aanointed Christians who have lived. To claim that the total number of anointed Christians has been less than 144.000 is beyond absurd.

*   [In A.D. 95  Domitian killed 40.000 Christians. (27% of 144.000)](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1951641#h=6)
*   [In A.D. 235 "numberless Christian victims were slain".](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1951641#h=11)
*   [In A.D. 303 **861.000** (17.000 + 144000 + 700.000)  Christians were killed](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1951641#h=16)
*   [The Watchtower considers Paulicians to be anointed Jehovah's witnesses](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1965208#h=7) (Paulicians existed from 650 to the 16th century. In 843, 100.000 Paulicians were killed. In 970 200,000 Paulicians were exiled to Thrace. There were way more than 144.000.)
*   [The Watchtower consider Waldenses to be Anointed.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1965208#h=8) ([Today they number 25.000)](https://www.oikoumene.org/member-churches/waldensian-church)

## Other information about the anointed

*   [Emblems and Manna both symbolizes Jesus body. Even non-israelites (representing "other sheep") ate the manna. Jesus also said we must eat his body to get everlasting life. Hence "other sheep" should also eat the emblems.](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1988090#h=5:0-7:813)
*   [If no anointed is present at the memorial, there is no need for emblems to be present either](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1985128#h=6)
