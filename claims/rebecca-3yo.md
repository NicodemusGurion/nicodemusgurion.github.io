# Start

The claim is that Rebecca in the Bible was married off to Isaac at the age of 3. This claim is made to somehow justify that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6 and consummated the marriage when she was 9, as described in [Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130), [3896](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3896), [5133](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5133), [5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134), [5158](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5158), [Sahih Muslim 1422c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c), [1422b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422b), [1876](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1876), [1982](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1982), [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4931](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4931), [2121](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121), and [Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378).

As we can see from the Bible, [Rebecca was definitely not 3 years old when she got married](#rebecca-was-not-3).

But for the sake of argument, let's *assume* that Isaac actually *did* marry Rebecca when she was 3 years old; Do you personally think that doing so would have been a morally good thing to do?

- Yes, Isaac did the morally good thing # Adult men may marry toddlers
- No, Isaac was a morally despicable man # Adult men may not marry toddlers


# Adult men may marry toddlers

So you think that it is ok for an adult man to marry a toddler? Then you should probably be in prison.

# Adult men may not marry toddlers

So if Isaac was a morally despicable man if he married Rebecca at age 3, why would you use a morally despicable man to justify that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6, and had sex with her at age 9? Wouldnâ€™t that also mean that Muhammad was an even worse man?

(By the way, the age gap between Isaac and Rebecca would be 37 years, and the age gap between Muhammad and Aisha would be 47 years.)

- Yes, Muhammad was despicable # Muhammad was despicable
- No, Muhammad was a good moral example in marrying a child > /cases/aisha/ 


# Muhammad was despicable

I am glad we agree on the fact that Muhammad was a despicable human being. 

So why not take this opportunity to officially reject him, and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior?

In the presence of witnesses please declare:

> "I reject Muhammad. He was a false prophet and a despicable man who is burning in hell right now. I renounce Islam, and accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Lord Jesus, I believe that you are God. I believe that you came into the world to save sinners. I believe you died on the cross for my sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the grave to defeat death. Please save me and allow me to follow you as my Lord."
