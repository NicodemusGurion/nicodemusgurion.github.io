# Cosmology

In Islamic cosmology, there are 7 heavens, and 7 flat earths, stacked on top of one another like flapjacks on a plate. These earths rest on the back of a [the cosmic whale Nun.](https://wikiislam.net/wiki/The_Islamic_Whale) The whale is on top of the cosmic Bull Bahamut. (Or sometimes the other way around. Bahamut stands on rock, and under the rock is dust. And I guess after that it's dust all the way down...

## The Whale Nun {#nun}

Surah 68:1

> Nūn , by the pen and what they write

The commentary [Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâs](https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=68&tAyahNo=1&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2) has this to say about Nun:

> (Nun) He says: Allah swears by the Nun, which is the whale that carries the earth**s** on its back while in Water, and beneath which is the Bull and under the Bull is the Rock and under the Rock is the Dust and none knows what is under the Dust save Allah. The name of the whale is Liwash, and it is said its name is Lutiaya'; the name of the bull is Bahamut, and some say its name is Talhut or Liyona. The whale is in a sea called 'Adwad, and it is like a small bull in a huge sea. The sea is in a hollowed rock whereby there is 4,000 cracks, and from each crack water springs out to the earth. 

## There are 7 heavens and 7 earths

Surah 65:12

> Allah is He Who created seven Firmaments and of the earth a similar number.


## Earth is flat 

Surah 2:22;15:19;20:53;43:10;50:7;51:48;71:19;78:6-7;79:30;88:20;91:6


# Hygiene, health and food

There's a surprising amount of rules about urinating. If your religion micromanages how you piss, you're in a cult.

See also [Muhammad and hygiene](/islam/muhammad/#muhammad-hygiene).

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate standing {#no-urinating-standing}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 308](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:308) 

> … 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing up.' So I never urinated whilst standing after that."

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate in water {#no-urinating-in-water}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 343](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:343) 

> …The Messenger of Allah forbade urinating into standing water.

So it seems our Muslim brothers can not urinate into a water toilet, especially not standing up.

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate  in holes {#urinating-in-holes}

> The Prophet prohibited to urinate in a hole. Qatadah (a narrator) was asked about the reason for the disapproval of urinating in a hole. He replied: It is said that these (holes) are the habitats of the jinn.

You don't want to piss of the jinn.

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate towards the qibla {#urinating-toward-qibla}

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

> And narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah: My father said. "During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the dogs used to urinate, and pass through the mosques (come and go), nevertheless they never used to sprinkle water on it (urine of the dog.)"

Letting that poor girl go to her wedding bald, just because he had a weird thing about wigs and an obsession with micromanaging the minutiae of everyone's lives.
