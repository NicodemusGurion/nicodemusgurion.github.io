| <span id="v1" data-verse="69:1" data-tags="">1</span> | The Reality! | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="69:2" data-tags="">2</span> | What is the Reality ? | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="69:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="69:4" data-tags="">4</span> | (The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="69:5" data-tags="">5</span> | As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="69:6" data-tags="">6</span> | And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="69:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="69:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="69:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were destroyed, brought error, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="69:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them with a tightening grip. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="69:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="69:12" data-tags="">12</span> | That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that heard the story) might remember. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="69:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And when the trumpet shall sound one blast | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="69:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one crash, | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="69:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Then, on that day will the Event befall. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="69:16" data-tags="">16</span> | And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="69:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne of thy Lord that day, above them. | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="69:18" data-tags="">18</span> | On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="69:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take, read my book! | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="69:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="69:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Then he will be in blissful state | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="69:22" data-tags="">22</span> | In a high garden | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="69:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="69:24" data-tags="">24</span> | (And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which ye sent on before you in past days. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="69:25" data-tags="">25</span> | But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh, would that I had not been given my book | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="69:26" data-tags="">26</span> | And knew not what my reckoning! | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="69:27" data-tags="">27</span> | Oh, would that it had been death! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="69:28" data-tags="">28</span> | My wealth hath not availed me, | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="69:29" data-tags="">29</span> | My power hath gone from me. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="69:30" data-tags="">30</span> | (It will be said): Take him and fetter him | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="69:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And then expose him to hell-fire | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="69:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="69:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="69:34" data-tags="">34</span> | And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="69:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Therefor hath he no lover here this day, | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="69:36" data-tags="">36</span> | Nor any food save filth | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="69:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Which none but sinners eat. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="69:38" data-tags="">38</span> | But nay! I swear by all that ye see | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="69:39" data-tags="">39</span> | And all that ye see not | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="69:40" data-tags="">40</span> | That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="69:41" data-tags="">41</span> | It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="69:42" data-tags="">42</span> | Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="69:43" data-tags="">43</span> | It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="69:44" data-tags="">44</span> | And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="69:45" data-tags="">45</span> | We assuredly had taken him by the right hand | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="69:46" data-tags="">46</span> | And then severed his life-artery, | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="69:47" data-tags="">47</span> | And not one of you could have held Us off from him. | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="69:48" data-tags="">48</span> | And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="69:49" data-tags="">49</span> | And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="69:50" data-tags="">50</span> | And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="69:51" data-tags="">51</span> | And lo! it is absolute truth. | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="69:52" data-tags="">52</span> | So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord. | |
