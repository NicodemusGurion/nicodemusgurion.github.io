| <span id="v1" data-verse="37:1" data-tags="">1</span> | By those who set the ranks in battle order | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="37:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="37:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="37:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Lo! thy Lord is surely One; | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="37:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord of the sun's risings. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="37:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="37:7" data-tags="">7</span> | With security from every froward devil. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="37:8" data-tags="">8</span> | They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="37:9" data-tags="">9</span> | Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="37:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="37:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="37:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="37:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And heed not when they are reminded, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="37:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="37:15" data-tags="">15</span> | And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="37:16" data-tags="">16</span> | When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised (again) ? | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="37:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And our forefathers ? | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="37:18" data-tags="">18</span> | Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="37:19" data-tags="">19</span> | There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="37:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="37:21" data-tags="">21</span> | This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="37:22" data-tags="">22</span> | (And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together with their wives and what they used to worship | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="37:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="37:24" data-tags="">24</span> | And stop them, for they must be questioned. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="37:25" data-tags="">25</span> | What aileth you that ye help not one another ? | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="37:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Nay, but this day they make full submission. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="37:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="37:28" data-tags="">28</span> | They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke the truth). | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="37:29" data-tags="">29</span> | They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="37:30" data-tags="">30</span> | We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="37:31" data-tags="">31</span> | Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are about to taste (the doom). | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="37:32" data-tags="">32</span> | Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="37:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="37:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="37:35" data-tags="">35</span> | For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were scornful | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="37:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="37:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="37:38" data-tags="">38</span> | Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="37:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Ye are requited naught save what ye did - | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="37:40" data-tags="">40</span> | Save single-minded slaves of Allah; | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="37:41" data-tags="">41</span> | For them there is a known provision, | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="37:42" data-tags="">42</span> | Fruits. And they will be honoured | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="37:43" data-tags="">43</span> | In the Gardens of delight, | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="37:44" data-tags="">44</span> | On couches facing one another; | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="37:45" data-tags="">45</span> | A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="37:46" data-tags="">46</span> | White, delicious to the drinkers, | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="37:47" data-tags="">47</span> | Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="37:48" data-tags="">48</span> | And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="37:49" data-tags="">49</span> | (Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="37:50" data-tags="">50</span> | And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="37:51" data-tags="">51</span> | A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="37:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="37:53" data-tags="">53</span> | Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we (then) verily be brought to book ? | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="37:54" data-tags="">54</span> | He saith: Will ye look ? | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="37:55" data-tags="">55</span> | Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="37:56" data-tags="">56</span> | He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="37:57" data-tags="">57</span> | And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled forth (to doom). | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="37:58" data-tags="">58</span> | Are we then not to die | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="37:59" data-tags="">59</span> | Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? | |
| <span id="v60" data-verse="37:60" data-tags="">60</span> | Lo! this is the supreme triumph. | |
| <span id="v61" data-verse="37:61" data-tags="">61</span> | For the like of this, then, let the workers work. | |
| <span id="v62" data-verse="37:62" data-tags="">62</span> | Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? | |
| <span id="v63" data-verse="37:63" data-tags="">63</span> | Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. | |
| <span id="v64" data-verse="37:64" data-tags="">64</span> | Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. | |
| <span id="v65" data-verse="37:65" data-tags="">65</span> | Its crop is as it were the heads of devils | |
| <span id="v66" data-verse="37:66" data-tags="">66</span> | And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. | |
| <span id="v67" data-verse="37:67" data-tags="">67</span> | And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water | |
| <span id="v68" data-verse="37:68" data-tags="">68</span> | And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. | |
| <span id="v69" data-verse="37:69" data-tags="">69</span> | They indeed found their fathers astray, | |
| <span id="v70" data-verse="37:70" data-tags="">70</span> | But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. | |
| <span id="v71" data-verse="37:71" data-tags="">71</span> | And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, | |
| <span id="v72" data-verse="37:72" data-tags="">72</span> | And verily We sent among them warners. | |
| <span id="v73" data-verse="37:73" data-tags="">73</span> | Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, | |
| <span id="v74" data-verse="37:74" data-tags="">74</span> | Save single-minded slaves of Allah. | |
| <span id="v75" data-verse="37:75" data-tags="">75</span> | And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer | |
| <span id="v76" data-verse="37:76" data-tags="">76</span> | And We saved him and his household from the great distress, | |
| <span id="v77" data-verse="37:77" data-tags="">77</span> | And made his seed the survivors, | |
| <span id="v78" data-verse="37:78" data-tags="">78</span> | And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): | |
| <span id="v79" data-verse="37:79" data-tags="">79</span> | Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! | |
| <span id="v80" data-verse="37:80" data-tags="">80</span> | Lo! thus do We reward the good. | |
| <span id="v81" data-verse="37:81" data-tags="">81</span> | Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. | |
| <span id="v82" data-verse="37:82" data-tags="">82</span> | Then We did drown the others. | |
| <span id="v83" data-verse="37:83" data-tags="">83</span> | And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham | |
| <span id="v84" data-verse="37:84" data-tags="">84</span> | When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; | |
| <span id="v85" data-verse="37:85" data-tags="">85</span> | When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? | |
| <span id="v86" data-verse="37:86" data-tags="">86</span> | Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? | |
| <span id="v87" data-verse="37:87" data-tags="">87</span> | What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? | |
| <span id="v88" data-verse="37:88" data-tags="">88</span> | And he glanced a glance at the stars | |
| <span id="v89" data-verse="37:89" data-tags="">89</span> | Then said: Lo! I feel sick! | |
| <span id="v90" data-verse="37:90" data-tags="">90</span> | And they turned their backs and went away from him. | |
| <span id="v91" data-verse="37:91" data-tags="">91</span> | Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? | |
| <span id="v92" data-verse="37:92" data-tags="">92</span> | What aileth you that ye speak not ? | |
| <span id="v93" data-verse="37:93" data-tags="">93</span> | Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. | |
| <span id="v94" data-verse="37:94" data-tags="">94</span> | And (his people) came toward him, hastening. | |
| <span id="v95" data-verse="37:95" data-tags="">95</span> | He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve | |
| <span id="v96" data-verse="37:96" data-tags="">96</span> | When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? | |
| <span id="v97" data-verse="37:97" data-tags="">97</span> | They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. | |
| <span id="v98" data-verse="37:98" data-tags="">98</span> | And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. | |
| <span id="v99" data-verse="37:99" data-tags="">99</span> | And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. | |
| <span id="v100" data-verse="37:100" data-tags="">100</span> | My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. | |
| <span id="v101" data-verse="37:101" data-tags="">101</span> | So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. | |
| <span id="v102" data-verse="37:102" data-tags="">102</span> | And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt find me of the steadfast. | |
| <span id="v103" data-verse="37:103" data-tags="">103</span> | Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down upon his face, | |
| <span id="v104" data-verse="37:104" data-tags="">104</span> | We called unto him: O Abraham! | |
| <span id="v105" data-verse="37:105" data-tags="">105</span> | Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. | |
| <span id="v106" data-verse="37:106" data-tags="">106</span> | Lo! that verily was a clear test. | |
| <span id="v107" data-verse="37:107" data-tags="">107</span> | Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. | |
| <span id="v108" data-verse="37:108" data-tags="">108</span> | And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): | |
| <span id="v109" data-verse="37:109" data-tags="">109</span> | Peace be unto Abraham! | |
| <span id="v110" data-verse="37:110" data-tags="">110</span> | Thus do We reward the good. | |
| <span id="v111" data-verse="37:111" data-tags="">111</span> | Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. | |
| <span id="v112" data-verse="37:112" data-tags="">112</span> | And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. | |
| <span id="v113" data-verse="37:113" data-tags="">113</span> | And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and some who plainly wrong themselves. | |
| <span id="v114" data-verse="37:114" data-tags="">114</span> | And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, | |
| <span id="v115" data-verse="37:115" data-tags="">115</span> | And saved them and their people from the great distress, | |
| <span id="v116" data-verse="37:116" data-tags="">116</span> | And helped them so that they became the victors. | |
| <span id="v117" data-verse="37:117" data-tags="">117</span> | And We gave them the clear Scripture | |
| <span id="v118" data-verse="37:118" data-tags="">118</span> | And showed them the right path. | |
| <span id="v119" data-verse="37:119" data-tags="">119</span> | And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): | |
| <span id="v120" data-verse="37:120" data-tags="">120</span> | Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! | |
| <span id="v121" data-verse="37:121" data-tags="">121</span> | Lo! thus do We reward the good. | |
| <span id="v122" data-verse="37:122" data-tags="">122</span> | Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. | |
| <span id="v123" data-verse="37:123" data-tags="">123</span> | And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), | |
| <span id="v124" data-verse="37:124" data-tags="">124</span> | When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v125" data-verse="37:125" data-tags="">125</span> | Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, | |
| <span id="v126" data-verse="37:126" data-tags="">126</span> | Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? | |
| <span id="v127" data-verse="37:127" data-tags="">127</span> | But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) | |
| <span id="v128" data-verse="37:128" data-tags="">128</span> | Save single-minded slaves of Allah. | |
| <span id="v129" data-verse="37:129" data-tags="">129</span> | And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): | |
| <span id="v130" data-verse="37:130" data-tags="">130</span> | Peace be unto Elias! | |
| <span id="v131" data-verse="37:131" data-tags="">131</span> | Lo! thus do We reward the good. | |
| <span id="v132" data-verse="37:132" data-tags="">132</span> | Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. | |
| <span id="v133" data-verse="37:133" data-tags="">133</span> | And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). | |
| <span id="v134" data-verse="37:134" data-tags="">134</span> | When We saved him and his household, every one, | |
| <span id="v135" data-verse="37:135" data-tags="">135</span> | Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; | |
| <span id="v136" data-verse="37:136" data-tags="">136</span> | Then We destroyed the others. | |
| <span id="v137" data-verse="37:137" data-tags="">137</span> | And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning | |
| <span id="v138" data-verse="37:138" data-tags="">138</span> | And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? | |
| <span id="v139" data-verse="37:139" data-tags="">139</span> | And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) | |
| <span id="v140" data-verse="37:140" data-tags="">140</span> | When he fled unto the laden ship, | |
| <span id="v141" data-verse="37:141" data-tags="">141</span> | And then drew lots and was of those rejected; | |
| <span id="v142" data-verse="37:142" data-tags="">142</span> | And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; | |
| <span id="v143" data-verse="37:143" data-tags="">143</span> | And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) | |
| <span id="v144" data-verse="37:144" data-tags="">144</span> | He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; | |
| <span id="v145" data-verse="37:145" data-tags="">145</span> | Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; | |
| <span id="v146" data-verse="37:146" data-tags="">146</span> | And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; | |
| <span id="v147" data-verse="37:147" data-tags="">147</span> | And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more | |
| <span id="v148" data-verse="37:148" data-tags="">148</span> | And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. | |
| <span id="v149" data-verse="37:149" data-tags="">149</span> | Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons ? | |
| <span id="v150" data-verse="37:150" data-tags="">150</span> | Or created We the angels females while they were present ? | |
| <span id="v151" data-verse="37:151" data-tags="">151</span> | Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: | |
| <span id="v152" data-verse="37:152" data-tags="">152</span> | Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. | |
| <span id="v153" data-verse="37:153" data-tags="">153</span> | (And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. | |
| <span id="v154" data-verse="37:154" data-tags="">154</span> | What aileth you ? How judge ye ? | |
| <span id="v155" data-verse="37:155" data-tags="">155</span> | Will ye not then reflect ? | |
| <span id="v156" data-verse="37:156" data-tags="">156</span> | Or have ye a clear warrant ? | |
| <span id="v157" data-verse="37:157" data-tags="">157</span> | Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. | |
| <span id="v158" data-verse="37:158" data-tags="">158</span> | And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before (Him). | |
| <span id="v159" data-verse="37:159" data-tags="">159</span> | Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), | |
| <span id="v160" data-verse="37:160" data-tags="">160</span> | Save single-minded slaves of Allah. | |
| <span id="v161" data-verse="37:161" data-tags="">161</span> | Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, | |
| <span id="v162" data-verse="37:162" data-tags="">162</span> | Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. | |
| <span id="v163" data-verse="37:163" data-tags="">163</span> | Save him who is to burn in hell. | |
| <span id="v164" data-verse="37:164" data-tags="">164</span> | There is not one of us but hath his known position. | |
| <span id="v165" data-verse="37:165" data-tags="">165</span> | Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, | |
| <span id="v166" data-verse="37:166" data-tags="">166</span> | Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise | |
| <span id="v167" data-verse="37:167" data-tags="">167</span> | And indeed they used to say: | |
| <span id="v168" data-verse="37:168" data-tags="">168</span> | If we had but a reminder from the men of old | |
| <span id="v169" data-verse="37:169" data-tags="">169</span> | We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. | |
| <span id="v170" data-verse="37:170" data-tags="">170</span> | Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. | |
| <span id="v171" data-verse="37:171" data-tags="">171</span> | And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) | |
| <span id="v172" data-verse="37:172" data-tags="">172</span> | That they verily would be helped, | |
