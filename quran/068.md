| <span id="v1" data-verse="68:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="68:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="68:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="68:4" data-tags="">4</span> | And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="68:5" data-tags="">5</span> | And thou wilt see and they will see | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="68:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Which of you is the demented. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="68:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who walk aright. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="68:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Therefor obey not thou the rejecters | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="68:9" data-tags="">9</span> | Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="68:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="68:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="68:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="68:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Greedy therewithal, intrusive. | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="68:14" data-tags="">14</span> | It is because he is possessed of wealth and children | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="68:15" data-tags="">15</span> | That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the men of old. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="68:16" data-tags="">16</span> | We shall brand him on the nose. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="68:17" data-tags="">17</span> | Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="68:18" data-tags="">18</span> | And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="68:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="68:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And in the morning it was as if plucked. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="68:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And they cried out one unto another in the morning, | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="68:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="68:23" data-tags="">23</span> | So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="68:24" data-tags="">24</span> | No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="68:25" data-tags="">25</span> | They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="68:26" data-tags="">26</span> | But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="68:27" data-tags="">27</span> | Nay, but we are desolate! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="68:28" data-tags="">28</span> | The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="68:29" data-tags="">29</span> | They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="68:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="68:31" data-tags="">31</span> | They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="68:32" data-tags="">32</span> | It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we beseech our Lord. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="68:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they did but know. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="68:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="68:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="68:36" data-tags="">36</span> | What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="68:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="68:38" data-tags="">38</span> | That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="68:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment, that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="68:40" data-tags="">40</span> | Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="68:41" data-tags="">41</span> | Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are truthful | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="68:42" data-tags="">42</span> | On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves but are not able, | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="68:43" data-tags="">43</span> | With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="68:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="68:45" data-tags="">45</span> | Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="68:46" data-tags="">46</span> | Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed ? | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="68:47" data-tags="">47</span> | Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="68:48" data-tags="">48</span> | But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried out in despair. | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="68:49" data-tags="">49</span> | Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="68:50" data-tags="">50</span> | But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="68:51" data-tags="">51</span> | And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="68:52" data-tags="">52</span> | When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. | |
