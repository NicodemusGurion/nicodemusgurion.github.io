# The classic dilemma

The classic Islamic dilemma is based on the fact that the Quran both affirms and contradicts the Bible, which leads to this dilemma:

 

> If the Bible is true, the Quran is false.

> If the Bible is false, the Quran is false.

> Either way the Quran is false.


Here are the basic premises:

## The Quran affirms the Bible.
Surah 2:4,40-41,89,91,97,101,111,113,121,;3:3-4,23,58,78-79,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,48,66,68,84;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,48,105;26:196;28:48-49;29:27;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19 affirms the authority, preservation, and inspiration of the previous scriptures, i.e. the Bible. It's saying that the Bible is the Word of Allah, that the Bible is preserved and uncorrupted, and that both Jews, Christians, and Muslims must follow it.

Furthermore Surah 6:115 says that no one can change the word of Allah, meaning that both the text of the Quran and the Bible are immutable. Any claim that ["the Bible has been corrupted"](/dawah/bible-corrupted) is therefore a rejection of Islam.

## The Quran contradicts the Bible.

The Quran contradicts the Bible on many points. The most important points include but are not limited to that the Bible says that Jesus was crucified, died, resurrected, and that he is divine. (Matthew 26:64; 27:35,50; 28:5,6; Mark 1:2,3; 14:62; 15:25,37; 16:6; Luke 21:27; 23:33,46; 24:5-7; John 1:1-3,14; 8;58; 19:18,30;20:28; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Col 2:9; Heb 1:2,3,8; Rev 1:8 etc.) The Quran vehemently denies these fundamental doctrines of the Bible. (Surah 3:55; 4:157,171; 5:72,73,117;112:3)

## The Bible denies further revelation.

Furthermore the Bible denies any further revelation contradicting the message it has brought. (Gal 1:8)

## The dilemma explained simply

The Quran says that God gave the Bible before Islam and that it is from God and can't be changed.

But the Bible says Jesus died on the cross, rose from the dead, and is God.

The Quran says those things are not true.

So there are only two possibilities:

**Option 1:**

If the Bible is true then the Quran is contradicting with a true revelation from God. Therefore the Quran must be false.

**Option 2:**

If the Bible is false or corrupted, then the Quran is telling us to trust a false and corrupted book. Therefore the Quran must be false.

Either way, the Quran is false


# The Christian Islamic dilemma



1. Allah commands Christians to judge by the Gospel.
2. The Gospel Christians possess teaches:
    - Jesus died by crucifixion
    - Jesus rose from the dead
	- Jesus is Lord / divine
3.	Those teachings contradict Islam.
4.	Therefore:
	- If I obey Allah and judge by the Gospel I must conclude Islam is false.
	- If I refuse to judge by the Gospel Allah calls me rebellious.
	- If the Gospel is corrupted Allah is commanding me to judge by something unreliable or unusable.

The conclusion: 

No matter which option I choose, obedience to Surah 5:47 results in rejecting Islam.
