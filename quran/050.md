| <span id="v1" data-verse="50:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'an, | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="50:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Nay, but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them; and the disbelievers say: This is a strange thing: | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="50:3" data-tags="">3</span> | When we are dead and have become dust (shall we be brought back again) ? That would be a far return! | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="50:4" data-tags="">4</span> | We know that which the earth taketh of them, and with Us is a recording Book. | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="50:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Nay, but they have denied the truth when it came unto them, therefor they are now in troubled case. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="50:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Have they not then observed the sky above them, how We have constructed it and beautified it, and how there are no rifts therein ? | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="50:7" data-tags="">7</span> | And the earth have We spread out, and have flung firm hills therein, and have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="50:8" data-tags="">8</span> | A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave. | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="50:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="50:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And lofty date-palms with ranged clusters, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="50:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Provision (made) for men; and therewith We quicken a dead land. Even so will be the resurrection of the dead. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="50:12" data-tags="">12</span> | The folk of Noah denied (the truth) before them, and (so did) the dwellers at Ar-Rass and (the tribe of) Thamud, | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="50:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And (the tribe of) A'ad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="50:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And the dwellers in the wood, and the folk of Tubb'a: every one denied their messengers, therefor My threat took effect. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="50:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Were We then worn out by the first creation ? Yet they are in doubt about a new creation. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="50:16" data-tags="">16</span> | We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="50:17" data-tags="">17</span> | When the two Receivers receive (him), seated on the right hand and on the left, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="50:18" data-tags="">18</span> | He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="50:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And the agony of death cometh in truth. (And it is said unto him): This is that which thou wast wont to shun. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="50:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And the trumpet is blown. This is the threatened Day. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="50:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And every soul cometh, along with it a driver and a witness. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="50:22" data-tags="">22</span> | (And unto the evil-doer it is said): Thou wast in heedlessness of this. Now We have removed from thee thy covering, and piercing is thy sight this day. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="50:23" data-tags="">23</span> | And (unto the evil-doer) his comrade saith: This is that which I have ready (as testimony). | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="50:24" data-tags="">24</span> | (And it is said): Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate, | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="50:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="50:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Who setteth up another god along with Allah. Do ye twain hurl him to the dreadful doom. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="50:27" data-tags="">27</span> | His comrade saith: Our Lord! I did not cause him to rebel, but he was (himself) far gone in error. | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="50:28" data-tags="">28</span> | He saith: Contend not in My presence, when I had already proffered unto you the warning. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="50:29" data-tags="">29</span> | The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed, and I am in no wise a tyrant unto the slaves. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="50:30" data-tags="">30</span> | On the day when We say unto hell: Art thou filled ? and it saith: Can there be more to come ? | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="50:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil, no longer distant. | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="50:32" data-tags="">32</span> | (And it is said): This is that which ye were promised. (It is) for every penitent and heedful one, | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="50:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="50:34" data-tags="">34</span> | Enter it in peace. This is the day of immortality. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="50:35" data-tags="">35</span> | There they have all that they desire, and there is more with Us. | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="50:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And how many a generation We destroyed before them, who were mightier than these in prowess so that they overran the lands! Had they any place of refuge (when the judgment came) ? | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="50:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Lo! therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear with full intelligence. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="50:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of weariness touched Us. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="50:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say, and hymn the praise of thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun; | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="50:40" data-tags="">40</span> | And in the night-time hymn His praise, and after the (prescribed) prostrations. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="50:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place, | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="50:42" data-tags="">42</span> | The day when they will hear the (Awful) Cry in truth. That is the day of coming forth (from the graves). | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="50:43" data-tags="">43</span> | Lo! We it is Who quicken and give death, and unto Us is the journeying. | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="50:44" data-tags="">44</span> | On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them, hastening forth (they come). That is a gathering easy for Us (to make). | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="50:45" data-tags="">45</span> | We are Best Aware of what they say, and thou (O Muhammad) art in no wise a compeller over them. But warn by the Qur'an him who feareth My threat. | |
