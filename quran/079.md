| <span id="v1" data-verse="79:1" data-tags="">1</span> | By those who drag forth to destruction, | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="79:2" data-tags="">2</span> | By the meteors rushing, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="79:3" data-tags="">3</span> | By the lone stars floating, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="79:4" data-tags="">4</span> | By the angels hastening, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="79:5" data-tags="">5</span> | And those who govern the event, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="79:6" data-tags="">6</span> | On the day when the first trump resoundeth. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="79:7" data-tags="">7</span> | And the second followeth it, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="79:8" data-tags="">8</span> | On that day hearts beat painfully | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="79:9" data-tags="">9</span> | While eyes are downcast | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="79:10" data-tags="">10</span> | (Now) they are saying: Shall we really be restored to our first state | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="79:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Even after we are crumbled bones ? | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="79:12" data-tags="">12</span> | They say: Then that would be a vain proceeding. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="79:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Surely it will need but one shout, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="79:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And lo! they will be awakened. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="79:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Hath there come unto thee the history of Moses ? | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="79:16" data-tags="">16</span> | How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="79:17" data-tags="">17</span> | (Saying:) Go thou unto Pharaoh - Lo! he hath rebelled - | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="79:18" data-tags="">18</span> | And say (unto him): Hast thou (will) to grow (in grace) ? | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="79:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Then I will guide thee to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him). | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="79:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And he showed him the tremendous token. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="79:21" data-tags="">21</span> | But he denied and disobeyed, | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="79:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Then turned he away in haste, | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="79:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Then gathered he and summoned | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="79:24" data-tags="">24</span> | And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest." | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="79:25" data-tags="">25</span> | So Allah seized him (and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former. | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="79:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for him who feareth. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="79:27" data-tags="">27</span> | Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built ? | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="79:28" data-tags="">28</span> | He raised the height thereof and ordered it; | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="79:29" data-tags="">29</span> | And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="79:30" data-tags="">30</span> | And after that He spread the earth, | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="79:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof, | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="79:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And He made fast the hills, | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="79:33" data-tags="">33</span> | A provision for you and for your cattle. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="79:34" data-tags="">34</span> | But when the great disaster cometh, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="79:35" data-tags="">35</span> | The day when man will call to mind his (whole) endeavour, | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="79:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth, | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="79:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Then, as for him who rebelled | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="79:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And chose the life of the world, | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="79:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Lo! hell will be his home. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="79:40" data-tags="">40</span> | But as for him who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained his soul from lust, | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="79:41" data-tags="">41</span> | Lo! the Garden will be his home. | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="79:42" data-tags="">42</span> | They ask thee of the Hour: when will it come to port ? | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="79:43" data-tags="">43</span> | Why (ask they) ? What hast thou to tell thereof ? | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="79:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="79:45" data-tags="">45</span> | Thou art but a warner unto him who feareth it. | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="79:46" data-tags="">46</span> | On the day when they behold it, it will be as if they had but tarried for an evening or the morn thereof. | |
