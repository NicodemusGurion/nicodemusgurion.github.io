# Hell

## Murder victims go to hell

[Sahih al-Bukhari 31](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:31)

> When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.

## All people go to hell

Surah 19:71

> There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.

So apparently all people, including all Muslims, will go to hell. It's up to the iffy and contradictory means of [salvation](#salvation) that anyone would get out of there.



# Hygiene, health and food

There's a surprising amount of rules about urinating. If your religion micromanages how you piss, you're in a cult.

See also [Muhammad and hygiene](#muhammad-hygiene).

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate standing {#no-urinating-standing}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 308](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:308) 

> … 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah saw me urinating while standing, and he said: 'O 'Umar, do not urinate standing up.' So I never urinated whilst standing after that."

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate in water {#no-urinating-in-water}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 343](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:343) 

> …The Messenger of Allah forbade urinating into standing water.

So it seems our Muslim brothers can not urinate into a water toilet, especially not standing up.

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate  in holes {#urinating-in-holes}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 29](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:29)

> The Prophet prohibited to urinate in a hole. Qatadah (a narrator) was asked about the reason for the disapproval of urinating in a hole. He replied: It is said that these (holes) are the habitats of the jinn.

You don't want to piss of the jinn.

## Muslims aren’t allowed to urinate towards the qibla {#urinating-toward-qibla}

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

> "The Messenger of Allah forbade facing the Qiblah when urinating. "

## Dogs would urinate in the mosque and no one would clean it up {#dogs-pissing-in-mosque}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 174](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:174)

> And narrated Hamza bin 'Abdullah: My father said. "During the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, the dogs used to urinate, and pass through the mosques (come and go), nevertheless they never used to sprinkle water on it (urine of the dog.)"


## People used to urinate in the mosque

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 329](https://sunnah.com/nasai:329)

> It was narrated from Anas that a Bedouin urinated in the Masjid, and some of the people went after him, but the Messenger of Allah said: "Do not restrain him." When he had finished he called from a bucket (of water) and poured over it.

## Don't come to mosque with garlic breath {#garlic}

[Sahih al Bukhari 5451](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5451)

> Narrated Abdul Aziz: It was said to Anas "What did you hear the Prophet  saying about garlic?" Anas replied, "Whoever has eaten (garlic) should not approach our mosque."

## Don't sleep on your stomach

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3723](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3723)

> "The Messenger of Allah found me sleeping in the masjid on my stomach. He nudged me with his foot and said: 'Why are you sleeping like this? This is a kind of sleep that Allah dislikes,' or 'that Allah hates.'"

## Wigs are forbidden {#no-wigs}

[Riyad as-Salihin 1642](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1642)

> A woman came to the Prophet and said: "O Messenger of Allah! I have a daughter who had an attack of small pox and her hair fell off. Now I want to celebrate her marriage. Can I get her a wig?" Thereupon the Prophet said, "Allah has cursed the maker and wearer of a wig."

Letting that poor girl go to her wedding bald, just because he had a weird thing about wigs and an obsession with micromanaging the minutiae of everyone's lives.

## Fevers cleanses sins

[Riyad as-Salihin 1726](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1726)

> "Do not revile fever, for it cleanses out the sins of the sons of Adam in the same way that a furnace removes the dirt of iron."

## Muslims should dip flies in their drinks {#dip-flies}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3320](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3320)

> The Prophet said "If a house fly falls in the drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink) and take it out, for one of its wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease."

🤮







# Islam


## Islam is a strange serpent receding into its hole

[Sahih Muslim 146](https://sunnah.com/muslim:146)

> the Messenger of Allah observed: Verily Islam started as something strange and it would again revert (to its old position) of being strange just as it started, and it would recede between the two mosques just as the serpent crawls back into its hole.

If he was a prophet then let's hope this prophecy comes true at least.

## Islam means following Muhammad 

Surah 4:65

> But no! By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they accept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes, and find no resistance within themselves against your decision and submit wholeheartedly.

## View of non-Muslims

Surah 98:6

> Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the worst of ˹all˺ beings

Islam views non-Muslims as the worst of all beings.

## Leaving Islam

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4061](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4061)

> "The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever changes his religion, kill him.'"


## Backgammon is forbidden

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3763](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3763)

> Whoever plays backgammon, it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.

## Stoning is monkey business 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3849](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3849)

> During the pre-lslamic period of ignorance I saw a she-monkey surrounded by a number of monkeys. They were all stoning it, because it had committed illegal sexual intercourse. I too, stoned it along with them.

Seems like monkeys and Muslims are allies in woman hating.






# Jesus Christ

What Islam teaches about Jesus varies. Some things are more or less accurate, but many things are false, antichristian and blasphemous.

## Jesus is free of sin

Surah 19:19 

The angel said to Mary about Jesus:

> He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on you a faultless son.

## Jesus was not crucified 

Surah 4:157

> and their saying, “We have surely killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah. ”In fact, they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And indeed, those who differed over him are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it—just following assumptions. And certainly, they did not kill him.

This is probably the most damning verse in the Quran, because it not only goes against the Bible and the testimony of documented history, proving that Islam is factually false and a lie, but it also leads billions of people away from salvation. 

## Jesus is Lord along with Allah

Surah 9:31

> They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allāh and the Messiah, the son of Mary.

This is one of the many passages where the English translations lie to hide the meaning. The Arabic says "ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًۭا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ" which translates as "They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allah and the Messiah, son of Mary."

So the error of these people is to take the rabbis and monks as lords, when they already have sufficient lords in Allah AND the Messiah. So it  admits that Jesus is Lord beside Allah. 

## The First and the Last

Surah 57:3

> [Allah] is the First and the Last, and the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing about every thing.

Christians agree that "The First and the Last" is a title that only belongs to God. But in Revelation 1:17, Jesus uses this term to describe himself, proving that Jesus is God, and Allah is Jesus.

## King of kings

[Riyad as-Salihin 1724](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1724)

> The Prophet said, "The most disgraceful man near Allah is a man who calls himself (or likes others to call him) Malikul-Amlak (i.e., king of kings)."

Allah seemingly dislikes the King of Kinfs. But Jesus Christ is called "The King of Kings", a title that only belongs to God. So if Muslims respect Jesus they must respect his divine title.

## Kibg if the Kingdom of Heaven and Earth

Surah 57:5

> To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah all matters are returned.

Jesus is the king of the kingdom of heaven and the earth. See John 18:36, Philippians 2:9-11, Revelation 11:15 and Daniel 7:27

## Will judge mankind

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3448](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3448)

> Allah's Messenger said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely Jesus, the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly as a Just Ruler.

Last I checked, only God can judge humanity. Why don't Muslims follow the future king and judge of mankind?

## Is alive in heaven with Allah

Surah 3:55

> Allah said, “O Jesus! I will take you1 and raise you up to Myself. I will deliver you from those who disbelieve, and elevate your followers above the disbelievers until the Day of Judgment. 

Surah 4:157-158

> Rather, Allah raised him (Jesus) up to Himself. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.


## Jesus is the Word of Allah and a spirit from him

Surah 4:171

> The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was a messenger of Allah, and His word which He cast down to Mary, and a spirit from Him.

[Riyad as-Salihin 412](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:412)

> Jesus is His Word which He communicated to Mary and His spirit which He sent to her





# Jews

## Allah favors Jews

Surah 45:16

> Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood; granted them good, lawful provisions; and favoured them above the others.

## Allah ordained that Israel would live in the holy land

Surah 5:21

> O my people! Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you. Turn not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers:


## A tribe of Israelites were turned into rats {#rats}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3305](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3305)

> The Prophet said, "A group of Israelites were lost. Nobody knows what they did. But I do not see them except that they were cursed and changed into rats, for if you put the milk of a she-camel in front of a rat, it will not drink it, but if the milk of a sheep is put in front of it, it will drink it."


## Jews are equal to asses and pigs

[Mishkat al-Masabih 789](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:789)

> When one of you prays without a sutra, an ass, a pig, a Jew, a Magian, and a woman cut off his prayer.

## The verse Muslims use to lie that Islam is peaceful {#peaceful}

Surah 5:32

> That is why We ordained **for the Children of Israel** that whoever takes a life—**unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land**—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.

This verse is often quoted by Muslims doing taqiyya to say that Islam is peaceful. But as you can see, it is a command directed to the people of Israel, not Muslims. 

It is a quotation from the Talmud. So the Quran is actually saying that the commentary by a rabbi in the Talmud is "revelation from Allah."

Also notice that this command has the stipulation "unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land", meaning that Jews had the right of capital punishment for those spreading mischief in the land. But in other cases, killing one person would be like killing all of humanity.

And what "land" is it talking about? Well, the land of the Jews, Israel, or Palestine as it was later renamed. 

*So according to the Quran, the Jews has the right to execute capital punishment on those spreading mischief in the land of Israel.*

But wait, it gets better. The next verse is what applies to Muslims:

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty **for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger** and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.** This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous **punishment in the Hereafter.**

This is directed to Muslims, how to deal with those who "who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land". The Muslims are to kill, crucify, dismember and exile people. And after they die, Allah sends them to hell."

## Islam's Final Solution to the Jewish Question {#final-solution}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."












# Jihad

See also [Violence](#violence) and [Muhammad and violence](#muhammad-and-violence).

## The goal of Islam

[Sahih al-Bukhari 25](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:25)

> Allah's Messenger said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to *fight against the people* until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then *they save their lives and property from me* except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."

## The second best deed

[Sahih al-Bukhari 26](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:26)

> Allah's Messenger was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then asked, "What is the next in goodness? He replied, "To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause."


## Jihadis are rewarded 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). 

## Those who die for Allah are the best of people

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.

## Whoever does not fight is a hypocrite

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3097](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3097)

> "Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy."

## Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire



## The event that triggered Jihad {#allah-allows-jihad}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”

When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.









# Jinn

## Jinn can be Muslims 

[Sunan Abi Dawud 5257](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5257)

> In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam






## Jizya

Jizya is a tax that Islam demands from Jews and Christians in exchange for not killing them.

Surah 9:29

> Fight those of the People of the Book who do not [truly] believe in God and the Last Day, who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, who do not obey the rule of justice,until they pay the [jizya] tax and agree to submit.

[Sahih Muslim 1731a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1731a)

> …If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.…

This is the future of your country if you invite Islam: They will sooner or later take over, and if you do not join their ideology, you will have to pay a tax to them. And if you refuse to pay them, they will kill you.

## Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "[The institution of Hima (sanctuary)](#hima) is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

### "Hima"

In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.

## Fight until unbelievers convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…
