> <span id="v1">1</span> Woe to every slandering defamer,

The surah opens with a pronouncement of judgment (“woe”), targeting verbal cruelty and social contempt. Christianity strongly affirms this moral concern: sins of the tongue are treated as spiritually deadly (James 3:6). From a Christian standpoint, this verse correctly identifies speech as a window into the heart, though it immediately moves to condemnation rather than repentance.

((104:1,slander, speech ethics, judgment, social sin, hypocrisy))


> <span id="v2">2</span> Who has gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it.

The target is now clarified: the slanderer is often wealthy, self-secure, and obsessed with accumulation. Wealth here is not neutral; it becomes a source of arrogance and false identity. Christianity closely parallels this critique (Luke 12:15; 1 Timothy 6:9), warning that wealth can distort moral vision.

((104:2,wealth, greed, materialism, false security, pride))


> <span id="v3">3</span> He thinks that his wealth will render him immortal.

> <span id="v4">4</span> No, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One.

> <span id="v5">5</span> Ah, what will convey to you what the Consuming One is!

> <span id="v6">6</span> (It is) the fire of Allah, kindled,

> <span id="v7">7</span> Which leaps up over the hearts (of men).

> <span id="v8">8</span> See! it is closed in on them

> <span id="v9">9</span> In outstretched columns.
