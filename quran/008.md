> <span id="v1">1</span> They ask you (O Muhammad) of the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to Allah and the messenger, so keep your duty to Allah, and adjust the matter of your difference, and obey Allah and His messenger, if you are (true) believers.

> <span id="v2">2</span> They only are the (true) believers whose hearts feel fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His revelations are recited to them they increase their faith, and who trust in their Lord;

> <span id="v3">3</span> Who establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed on them.

> <span id="v4">4</span> Those are they who are in truth believers. For them are grades (of honour) with their Lord, and pardon, and a bountiful provision.

> <span id="v5">5</span> Even as your Lord caused you (Muhammad) to go forth from your home with the Truth, and see! a party of the believers were averse (to it).

> <span id="v6">6</span> Disputing with you of the Truth after it had been made manifest, as if they were being driven to death visible.

> <span id="v7">7</span> And when Allah promised you one of the two bands (of the enemy) that it should be yours, and you longed that other than the armed one might be yours. And Allah willed that He should cause the Truth to triumph by His words, and cut the root of the disbelievers;

> <span id="v8">8</span> That He might cause the Truth to triumph and bring vanity to nothing, however much the guilty might oppose;

> <span id="v9">9</span> When you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): I will help you with a thousand of the angels, rank on rank.

> <span id="v10">10</span> Allah appointed it only as good tidings, and that your hearts thereby might be at rest. Victory cometh only by the help of Allah. See! Allah is Mighty, Wise.

> <span id="v11">11</span> When He made the slumber fall upon you as a reassurance from him and sent down water from the sky upon you, that thereby He might purify you, and remove from you the fear of Satan, and make strong your hearts and firm (your) feet thereby.

> <span id="v12">12</span> When your Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.

> <span id="v13">13</span> That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger. Whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, (for him) see! Allah is severe in punishment.

> <span id="v14">14</span> That (is the award), so taste it, and (know) that for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire.

> <span id="v15">15</span> O you who believe! When you meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them.

> <span id="v16">16</span> Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly has incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.

> <span id="v17">17</span> Ye (Muslims) slew them not, but Allah slew them. And you (Muhammad) threwest not when you didst throw, but Allah threw, that He might test the believers by a fair test from Him. See! Allah is Hearer, Knower.

> <span id="v18">18</span> That (is the case); and (know) that Allah (it is) Who maketh weak the plan of disbelievers.

> <span id="v19">19</span> (O Qureysh!) If you sought a judgment, now has the judgment come to you. And if you cease (from persecuting the believers) it will be better for you, but if you return (to the attack) We also shall return. And your host will avail you nothing, however numerous it be, and (know) that Allah is with the believers (in His Guidance).

> <span id="v20">20</span> O you who believe! Obey Allah and His messenger, and turn not away from him when you hear (him speak).

> <span id="v21">21</span> Be not as those who say, we hear, and they hear not.

> <span id="v22">22</span> See! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the deaf, the dumb, who have no sense.

> <span id="v23">23</span> Had Allah known of any good in them He would have made them hear, but had He made them hear they would have turned away, averse.

> <span id="v24">24</span> O you who believe! Obey Allah, and the messenger when He calleth you to that which quickeneth you, and know that Allah cometh in between the man and his own heart, and that He it is to Whom you will be gathered.

> <span id="v25">25</span> And guard yourselves against a chastisement which cannot fall exclusively on those of you who are wrong-doers, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.

> <span id="v26">26</span> And remember, when you were few and reckoned feeble in the land, and were in fear lest men should extirpate you, how He gave you refuge, and strengthened you with His help, and made provision of good things for you, that haply you might be thankful.

> <span id="v27">27</span> O you who believe! Betray not Allah and His messenger, nor knowingly betray your trusts.

> <span id="v28">28</span> And know that your possessions and your children are a test, and that with Allah is immense reward.

> <span id="v29">29</span> O you who believe! If you keep your duty to Allah, He will give you discrimination (between right and wrong) and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds, and will forgive you. Allah is of Infinite Bounty.

> <span id="v30">30</span> And when those who disbelieve plot against you (O Muhammad) to wound you fatally, or to kill you or to drive you forth; they plot, but Allah (also) plotteth; and Allah is the best of plotters.

> <span id="v31">31</span> And when Our revelations are recited to them they say: We have heard. If we wish we can speak the like of this. See! this is nothing but fables of the men of old.

> <span id="v32">32</span> And when they said: O Allah! If this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom!

> <span id="v33">33</span> But Allah would not punish them while you wast with them, nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness.

> <span id="v34">34</span> What (plea) have they that Allah should not punish them, when they debar (His servants) from the Inviolable Place of Worship, though they are not its fitting guardians. Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to Allah. But most of them know not.

> <span id="v35">35</span> And their worship at the (holy) House is nothing but whistling and hand- clapping. Therefore (it is said to them): Taste of the doom because you disbelieve.

> <span id="v36">36</span> See! those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar (men) from the way of Allah. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they will be conquered. And those who disbelieve will be gathered to hell,

> <span id="v37">37</span> That Allah may separate the wicked from the good, The wicked will He place piece upon piece, and heap them all together, and consign them to hell. Such verily are the losers.

> <span id="v38">38</span> Tell those who disbelieve that if they cease (from persecution of believers) that which is past will be forgiven them; but if they return (thereto) then the example of the men of old has already gone (before them, for a warning).

> <span id="v39">39</span> And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then see! Allah is Seer of what they do.

> <span id="v40">40</span> And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Befriender - a Transcendent Patron, a Transcendent Helper!

> <span id="v41">41</span> And know that whatever you take as spoils of war, see! a fifth thereof is for Allah, and for the messenger and for the kinsman (who has need) and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and that which We revealed to Our slave on the Day of Discrimination, the day when the two armies met. And Allah is Able to do all things.

> <span id="v42">42</span> When you were on the near bank (of the valley) and they were on the yonder bank, and the caravan was below you (on the coast plain). And had you trysted to meet one another you surely would have failed to keep the tryst, but (it happened, as it did, without the forethought of either of you) that Allah might conclude a thing that must be done; that he who perished (on that day) might perish by a clear proof (of His Sovereignty) and he who survived might survive by a clear proof (of His Sovereignty). See! Allah in truth is Hearer, Knower.

> <span id="v43">43</span> When Allah showed them to you (O Muhammad) in your dream as few in number, and if He had shown them to you as many, you (Muslims) would have faltered and would have quarrelled over the affair. But Allah saved (you). See! He knows what is in the breasts (of men).

> <span id="v44">44</span> And when He made you (Muslims), when you met (them), see them with your eyes as few, and lessened you in their eyes, (it was) that Allah might conclude a thing that must be done. Unto Allah all things are brought back.

> <span id="v45">45</span> O you who believe! When you meet an army, hold firm and think of Allah much, that you may be successful.

> <span id="v46">46</span> And obey Allah and His messenger, and dispute not one with another lest you falter and your strength depart from you; but be steadfast! See! Allah is with the steadfast.

> <span id="v47">47</span> Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully and to be seen of men, and debar (men) from the way of Allah, while Allah is surrounding all they do.

> <span id="v48">48</span> And when Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said: No-one of mankind can conquer you this day, for I am your protector. But when the armies came in sight of one another, he took flight, saying: See! I am guiltless of you. See! I see that which you see not. See! I fear Allah. And Allah is severe in punishment.

> <span id="v49">49</span> When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said: Their religion has deluded these. Whoso putteth his trust in Allah (will find that) see! Allah is Mighty, Wise.

> <span id="v50">50</span> If you couldst see how the angels receive those who disbelieve, smiting faces and their backs and (saying): Taste the punishment of burning!

> <span id="v51">51</span> This is for that which your own hands have sent before (to the Judgment), and (know) that Allah is not a tyrant to His slaves.

> <span id="v52">52</span> (Their way is) as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they disbelieved the revelations of Allah, and Allah took them in their sins. See! Allah is Strong, severe in punishment.

> <span id="v53">53</span> That is because Allah never changeth the grace He has bestowed on any people until they first change that which is in their hearts, and (that is) because Allah is Hearer, Knower.

> <span id="v54">54</span> (Their way is) as the way of Pharaoh's folk and those before them; they denied the revelations of their Lord, so We destroyed them in their sins. And We drowned the folk of Pharaoh. All were evil-doers.

> <span id="v55">55</span> See! the worst of beasts in Allah's sight are the ungrateful who will not believe.

> <span id="v56">56</span> Those of them with whom you madest a treaty, and then at every opportunity they break their treaty, and they keep not duty (to Allah).

> <span id="v57">57</span> If you comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.

> <span id="v58">58</span> And if you fearest treachery from any folk, then throw back to them (their treaty) fairly. See! Allah loveth not the treacherous.

> <span id="v59">59</span> And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's Purpose). See! they cannot escape.

> <span id="v60">60</span> Make ready for them all you canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby you may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside them whom you know not. Allah knows them. Whatsoever you spend in the way of Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.

> <span id="v61">61</span> And if they incline to peace, incline you also to it, and trust in Allah. See! He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower.

> <span id="v62">62</span> And if they would deceive you, then see! Allah is Sufficient for you. He it is Who supporteth you with His help and with the believers,

> <span id="v63">63</span> And (as for the believers) has attuned their hearts. If you hadst spent all that is in the earth you couldst not have attuned their hearts, but Allah has attuned them. See! He is Mighty, Wise.

> <span id="v64">64</span> O Prophet! Allah is Sufficient for you and those who follow you of the believers.

> <span id="v65">65</span> O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty steadfast they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a hundred (steadfast) they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers) are a folk without intelligence.

> <span id="v66">66</span> Now has Allah lightened your burden, for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two hundred, and if there be of you a thousand (steadfast) they shall overcome two thousand by permission of Allah. Allah is with the steadfast.

> <span id="v67">67</span> It is not for any prophet to have captives until he has made slaughter in the land. Ye desire the lure of this world and Allah desireth (for you) the Hereafter, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.

> <span id="v68">68</span> Had it not been for an ordinance of Allah which had gone before, an awful doom had come upon you on account of what you took.

> <span id="v69">69</span> Now enjoy what you have won, as lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah. See! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

> <span id="v70">70</span> O Prophet! Say to those captives who are in your hands: If Allah knows any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which has been taken from you, and will forgive you. See! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

> <span id="v71">71</span> And if they would betray you, they betrayed Allah before, and He gave (you) power over them. Allah is Knower, Wise.

> <span id="v72">72</span> See! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them: these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their homes, you have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help (them) except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. Allah is Seer of what you do.

> <span id="v73">73</span> And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another - If you do not so, there will be confusion in the land, and great corruption.

> <span id="v74">74</span> Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them - these are the believers in truth. For them is pardon, and bountiful provision.

> <span id="v75">75</span> And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you, they are of you; and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of Allah. See! Allah is Knower of all things.
