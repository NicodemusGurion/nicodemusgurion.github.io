| <span id="v1" data-verse="92:1" data-tags="">1</span> | By the night enshrouding | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="92:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And the day resplendent | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="92:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And Him Who hath created male and female, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="92:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Lo! your effort is dispersed (toward divers ends). | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="92:5" data-tags="">5</span> | As for him who giveth and is dutiful (toward Allah) | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="92:6" data-tags="">6</span> | And believeth in goodness; | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="92:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Surely We will ease his way unto the state of ease. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="92:8" data-tags="">8</span> | But as for him who hoardeth and deemeth himself independent, | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="92:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And disbelieveth in goodness; | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="92:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Surely We will ease his way unto adversity. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="92:11" data-tags="">11</span> | His riches will not save him when he perisheth. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="92:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Lo! Ours it is (to give) the guidance | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="92:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And lo! unto Us belong the latter portion and the former. | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="92:14" data-tags="">14</span> | Therefor have I warned you of the flaming Fire | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="92:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Which only the most wretched must endure, | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="92:16" data-tags="">16</span> | He who denieth and turneth away. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="92:17" data-tags="">17</span> | Far removed from it will be the righteous | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="92:18" data-tags="">18</span> | Who giveth his wealth that he may grow (in goodness). | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="92:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And none hath with him any favour for reward, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="92:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Except as seeking (to fulfil) the purpose of his Lord Most High. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="92:21" data-tags="">21</span> | He verily will be content. | |
