Claim: Jesus never claimed to be God; Christians invented that doctrine.

Why it’s false:
High Christological statements in the New Testament—especially in John 1, John 8, John 20, Philippians 2, and the Synoptic “Son of Man” claims—are very strong divine claims in a first-century Jewish context.
Even secular scholars acknowledge that the earliest Christian communities worshiped Jesus.
