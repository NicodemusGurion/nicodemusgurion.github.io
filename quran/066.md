> <span id="v1">1</span> O Prophet! Why bannest you that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives ? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

> <span id="v2">2</span> Allah has made lawful for you (Muslims) absolution from your oaths (of such a kind), and Allah is your Protector. He is the Knower, the Wise.

> <span id="v3">3</span> When the Prophet confided a fact to one of his wives and when she afterward divulged it and Allah apprised him thereof, he made known (to her) part thereof and passed over part. And when he told it her she said: Who has told you ? He said: The Knower, the Aware has told me.

> <span id="v4">4</span> If you twain turn to Allah repentant, (ye have cause to do so) for your hearts desired (the ban); and if you aid one another against him (Muhammad) then see! Allah, even He, is his Protecting Friend, and Gabriel and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore the angels are his helpers.

> <span id="v5">5</span> It may happen that his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your stead wives better than you, submissive (to Allah), believing, pious, penitent, devout, inclined to fasting, widows and maids.

> <span id="v6">6</span> O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire whereof the fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels strong, severe, who resist not Allah in that which He commandeth them, but do that which they are commanded.

> <span id="v7">7</span> (Then it will be said): O you who disbelieve! Make no excuses for yourselves this day. Ye are only being paid for what you used to do.

> <span id="v8">8</span> O you who believe! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! See! You are Able to do all things.

> <span id="v9">9</span> O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Hell will be their home, a hapless journey's end.

> <span id="v10">10</span> Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous slaves yet betrayed them so that they (the husbands) availed them nothing against Allah and it was said (unto them): Enter the Fire along with those who enter.

> <span id="v11">11</span> And Allah citeth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with you in the Garden, and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil-doing folk;

> <span id="v12">12</span> And Mary, daughter of 'Imran, whose body was chaste, therefore We breathed therein something of Our Spirit. And she put faith in the words of her Lord and His scriptures, and was of the obedient.
