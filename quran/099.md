| <span id="v1">1</span> | When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | And Earth yieldeth up her burdens, | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | And man saith: What aileth her ? | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | That day she will relate her chronicles, | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | Because thy Lord inspireth her. | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | That day mankind will issue forth in scattered groups to be shown their deeds. | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | And whoso doeth good an atom's weight will see it then, | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight will see it then. | |
