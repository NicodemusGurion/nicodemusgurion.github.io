| <span id="v1">1</span> | By the Dawn | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | And ten nights, | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | And the Even and the Odd, | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | And the night when it departeth, | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | There surely is an oath for thinking man. | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt with (the tribe of) A'ad, | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | With many-columned Iram, | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | The like of which was not created in the lands; | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove the rocks in the valley; | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | And with Pharaoh, firm of might, | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands, | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | And multiplied iniquity therein ? | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment. | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful. | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him by honouring him, and is gracious unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth me. | |
| <span id="v16">16</span> | But whenever He trieth him by straitening his means of life, he saith: My Lord despiseth me. | |
| <span id="v17">17</span> | Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan | |
| <span id="v18">18</span> | And urge not on the feeding of the poor. | |
| <span id="v19">19</span> | And ye devour heritages with devouring greed. | |
| <span id="v20">20</span> | And love wealth with abounding love. | |
| <span id="v21">21</span> | Nay, but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding, | |
| <span id="v22">22</span> | And thy Lord shall come with angels, rank on rank, | |
| <span id="v23">23</span> | And hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but how will the remembrance (then avail him) ? | |
| <span id="v24">24</span> | He will say: Ah, would that I had sent before me (some provision) for my life! | |
| <span id="v25">25</span> | None punisheth as He will punish on that day! | |
| <span id="v26">26</span> | None bindeth as He then will bind. | |
| <span id="v27">27</span> | But ah! thou soul at peace! | |
| <span id="v28">28</span> | Return unto thy Lord, content in His good pleasure! | |
| <span id="v29">29</span> | Enter thou among My bondmen! | |
| <span id="v30">30</span> | Enter thou My Garden! | |
