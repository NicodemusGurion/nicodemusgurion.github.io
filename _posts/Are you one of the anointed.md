Take this simple test specifically for Jehovah’s Witnesses to find out if they are one of the Anointed Christians, according to what the Bible teaches.

Watchtower teaching on how to know if you’re anointed is vague at best. To summarize it, you know that you’re anointed if you “feel it”, that is if God’s holy spirit is bearing witness to your spirit. But they never explain what it’s supposed to feel like. How do I know if what I’m feeling is not the anointing? How can I be sure what an anointed is feeling is not just indigestion? Their reassuring answer to these questions is simply “if you have to ask, you’re not anointed”, which is one of the most unhelpful things you could say, and I might add is severely unscriptural. Show me **one** scripture that supports this idea, just **one**.

So doing research into what it means to be anointed and how it affects you, I have made this very simple questionnaire to help you determine whether you are of the anointed or not.

# The Test

Please answer each of these questions with Yes or No:

1.  Do you believe that Jesus lived on earth? ([Matthew 2:1](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Matthew+2%3A1))
2.  Do you believe that Jesus was executed by the Romans? ([Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; John 19](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Matthew+27%3B+Mark+15%3B+Luke+23%3B+John+19))
3.  Do you believe Jesus was resurrected after 3 days in the grave? ([1 Corinthians 15:3,4](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=1+Corinthians+15%3A3%2C4))
4.  Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God? ([Matthew 16:16;John 6:40](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Matthew+16%3A16%3BJohn+6%3A40))
5.  Do you believe that Jesus gave his life as a ransom sacrifice for all people? ([1 Timothy 2:5,6](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=1+Timothy+2%3A5%2C6))
6.  Do you **have faith** that Jesus sacrifice saves you from sin, death and God’s wrath? ([1 John 1:7; John 3:36;6:40](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=1+John+1%3A7%3B+John+3%3A36%3B6%3A40))
7.  Do you understand that you can not add to what Jesus did or somehow earn your salvation by your own efforts and works? (Even though good works is a fruit of faith) ([Ephesians 2:8,9](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Ephesians+2%3A8%2C9))
8.  Do you see Jesus Christ as your Lord, wanting to follow his example and live according to his will? ([Romans 10:9,10](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Romans+10%3A9%2C10))

After accepting Jesus’ ransom sacrifice for your sins, have you noticed these transformations of your person to the better: ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=2+Corinthians+5%3A17))

*   You stop practicing sin or living a deliberately sinful life (even if you may slip up sometimes)? ([1 John 3:9;5:18;Rom 8:13](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=1+John+3%3A9%3B5%3A18%3BRom+8%3A13))
*   If you slip up and sin without intending to, do you feel shame or guilt? ([Romans 7:15; 9:9](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Romans+7%3A15%3B+9%3A9))
*   You notice an increased interest in spiritual things, like a hunger for reading the Bible? ([Romans 8:5](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Romans+8%3A5))
*   You show love toward people even if they aren’t loving to you? ([John 13:35; 1 John 5:1,2](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=John+13%3A35%3B1+John+5%3A1%2C2))
*   You feel troubled and sad about world conditions? ([Romans 8:23](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Romans+8%3A23))
*   You feel that your decisions are guided by the Bible and holy spirit? ([Romans 8:14](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Romans+8%3A14))

If you answered Yes to all these questions, it means that you are definitely Anointed by God’s Holy Spirit, and you are an adopted spirit-begotten son (or daughter) of God. ([Ephesians 1:13,14](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Ephesians+1%3A13%2C14))

Surprised?

# Here’s the scriptural proof.

_Please note that in the Bible the phrases “anointed”, “new birth”, “born again”, “born of the spirit”, “children of God”, “sons of God”, “in union with Christ” and “sealed by holy spirit” are all used interchangeably for spirit anointed Christians._

# Is the anointing only for a select few?

> _1 John 5:1 — **Everyone** who **believes that Jesus is the Christ**_ _**has been born from God**, and **everyone** who loves the one who caused to be born loves him who has been born from that one._
> 
> _John 1:12,13 — However, **to all** who did **receive** him, **he gave authority to become God’s children**, because they were **exercising faith in his name**. 13 And they were born, not from blood or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God._
> 
> _1 Timothy 2:5, 6 — 5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself a corresponding ransom **for all** — this is what is to be witnessed to in its own due time._
> 
> _Romans 8:14 — For **all** who are led by God’s spirit are indeed God’s sons._

The new birth is NOT something God’s hands out randomly to a few selected people. It is available to ALL, and all you have to do is to accept it and have faith in it!

> _1 Peter 1:3,23 — Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy **he gave us a new birth** to a living hope **through the resurrection of Jesus Christ** from the dead, […] 23 For you have been given a **new birth**, not by corruptible, but by incorruptible seed, **through the word** of the living and enduring God._

All you need to do to be born again as a Son of God is to have faith in Jesus as Christ and receive him. This is open to **ALL** people, to **EVERYONE**. That includes **YOU.**

# When does someone become anointed?

> _Ephesians 1:13, 14 — 13 But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. **After you believed, you were sealed by** means of him with the promised **holy spirit**, 14 which is a token in advance of our inheritance, for the purpose of releasing God’s own possession by a ransom, to his glorious praise._

Clearly all you need to do to be sealed by holy spirit is to believe the good news of salvation.

# The anointing helps us live a clean life.

> _1 John 3:9 — Everyone who has been born from God **does not practice sin**, for His seed remains in such one, and he cannot practice sin, for he has been born from God._
> 
> _1 John 5:18 — We know that everyone who has been born from God **does not practice sin**, but the one born from God **[Jesus] watches him**, and the wicked one cannot take hold of him._
> 
> _2 Corinthians 5:17 — Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, **he is a new creation**; the old things passed away; look! new things have come into existence._
> 
> _Romans 8:5 — For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but **those who live according to the spirit, [set their minds] on the things of the spirit**._

If you have a spiritual interest and love to read the Bible it is a clear sign that you are anointed.

> _Romans 8:13 — for if you live according to the flesh, you are sure to die; but if you **put the practices of the body to death by the spirit**, you will live._
> 
> _Romans 9:1 — I am telling the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as my conscience bears witness with me in holy spirit_

Holy Spirit helps us live a clean life through our Bible trained conscience.

# Is there an earthly as well as a heavenly hope?

> _Ephesians 4:4,5 — One body there is, and one spirit, just as you were called to the **one hope** of your calling; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism;_

The Bible **never** mentions a uniquely earthly hope for Christians. There is **only one hope** for Christians: _The Heavenly Hope_. This does not mean spending all of eternity in heaven without access to earth as the Society insinuates. No. It’s heavenly because it originates in heaven, but just like Jesus received a glorified body after his resurrection, so will Christians receive glorified bodies. These bodies **can transfer between heaven and earth and live in both**, just as Jesus’ body could. Hence the heavenly hope is **also** a hope to live on earth. **There is no distinction**. All Christians are anointed, all Christians go to heaven, and all Christians will live on earth, because heaven and earth will be united. ([Revelation 21:1–5](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/l/r1/lp-e?q=Revelation+21%3A1-5))

# What’s the resurrection/rapture like?

> _1 Corinthians 15:50–53 — 50 But I tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood **cannot inherit God’s Kingdom**, nor does corruption inherit incorruption. 51 Look! I tell you a sacred secret: We will not all fall asleep in death, but **we will all be changed, 52 in a moment**, in the blink of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and **we will be changed**. 53 For this which is corruptible must put on **incorruption**, and this which is mortal must put on **immortality**._
> 
> _1 Thessalonians 4:16 — 16 because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first._

(As a side note: If Jesus coming with an archangels voice means he’s an archangel, then by the same logic, Jesus coming with God’s trumpet would mean that he’s God.)

# Why is it so important that you become anointed, to be born again as a Son of God?

Because your future eternal life **depends** on it.

> _John 3:3 — 3 In response Jesus said to him: “Most truly I say to you, unless anyone is born again, **he cannot see the Kingdom of God**.”_

You can **not** see of the Kingdom unless you’re born again. If you’re not anointed, you will not enter Paradise.

> _Romans 8:8 — 8 So those who are in harmony with the flesh **cannot please God**._
> 
> _Romans 8:13a — for if you live according to the flesh, **you are sure to die**;_

Romans 8 clearly states that there are **only two** possible states you can be in, either in the spirit (anointed) or in the flesh. If you’re in the flesh you **cannot** please God and you **will die**.

# Must you partake of the Memorial emblems?

> _John 6:33,40,53–57 — 33 For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world [i.e. Jesus].” …40 For this is the will of my Father, that **everyone** who recognizes the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.”…53 So Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, **unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves**. 54 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will resurrect him on the last day; 55 for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will live because of me._

EVERY Christian should partake of the emblems. If you let the bread and the wine pass you by, you are **REJECTING JESUS CHRIST**!

# “The anointing only applies to the 144.000”

This idea was arrived at solely through an erroneous association between the mentioning of a “sealing” by holy spirit in the epistles of Paul, and the “sealing” of the 144.000 in Revelation 7:4\. But is this referring to the same thing? Let’s have a look:

> _2 Corinthians 1:21 — But the one who guarantees that you and we belong to Christ and **the one who anointed us is God**. 22 **He** has also put his **seal** on us and has given us the **token** of what is to come, that is, the spirit, in our hearts._
> 
> _Ephesians 4:30 — Also, do not be grieving God’s **holy spirit**, with which you have been **sealed** for a day of releasing by ransom._
> 
> _Ephesians 1:13, 14 — 13 But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. **After you believed, you were sealed by** means of him with the promised **holy spirit**, 14 which is a token in advance of our inheritance, **for the purpose of releasing God’s own possession by a ransom**, to his glorious praise._

In these cases here **God** puts his seal on us. **He** is sealing us. What does sealing mean? A seal has two functions.

**One**, it’s a marking that identifies a thing as belonging to someone, such as the seal someone would put on a contract or important document signifying its authority.

**Two**, a seal is a protection from tampering or decay, such as when you seal a jar of pickles so that air won’t get in, or like when the Roman soldiers put a seal on the grave of Jesus to make sure no one would open it.

As Ephesians 1:13,14 makes clear, the purpose of this sealing is to save us, to protect us, not to mark us out as special.

> _Revelation 7:2,4 — And I saw another **angel** ascending from the sunrise, having **a seal** of the living God; and he called with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, […] 4 And I heard the number of those who were **sealed**, 144,000, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:_

Firstly, who is doing the sealing here? An angel. The Society claims this is Jesus, because in Revelation **every** angel is Jesus apparently. But notice who it is **not**. It’s not **God**. So this sealing is not done by the same agent or person.

Secondly, the sealing this angel does has the function to mark out people. The sealing that God does has the function of preserving and saving us, giving us an assurance of our salvation.

Thirdly, the sealing of the 144.000 happens during the Great Tribulation, so it would be presumptuous to claim to be part of that group before the sealing has even happened.

Fourthly, the 144.000 are supposed to be Jewish virgin men. The Watchtower society claims that that is symbolic, but they also claim that the number is literal. It would make sense if both were symbolic, and it would make sense if both were literal, but it does not make sense to say that one is symbolic and one is literal. What’s to say the number isn’t symbolic and the qualifications are literal? So either the 144.000 is limited to Christian actually genetic Jews (both literal), or it applies to ALL Christians (both symbolic).

Fifthly, everything in Revelation that is “before the throne” is located in heaven. The Great Crowd is before the throne. Hence the Great Crowd is in heaven. The Great Crowd are all anointed Christians, **including you if you passed this test.**
