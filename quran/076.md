| <span id="v1" data-verse="76:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing unremembered ? | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="76:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make him hearing, knowing. | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="76:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="76:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging fire. | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="76:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="76:6" data-tags="">6</span> | A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth abundantly, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="76:7" data-tags="">7</span> | (Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="76:8" data-tags="">8</span> | And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him, | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="76:9" data-tags="">9</span> | (Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you; | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="76:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="76:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath made them find brightness and joy; | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="76:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="76:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun nor bitter cold. | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="76:14" data-tags="">14</span> | The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow down. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="76:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="76:16" data-tags="">16</span> | (Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have measured to the measure (of their deeds). | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="76:17" data-tags="">17</span> | There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="76:18" data-tags="">18</span> | (The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="76:19" data-tags="">19</span> | There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst take for scattered pearls. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="76:20" data-tags="">20</span> | When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="76:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="76:22" data-tags="">22</span> | (And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour (upon earth) hath found acceptance. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="76:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="76:24" data-tags="">24</span> | So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty one or disbeliever. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="76:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="76:26" data-tags="">26</span> | And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the livelong night. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="76:27" data-tags="">27</span> | Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a grievous day. | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="76:28" data-tags="">28</span> | We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="76:29" data-tags="">29</span> | Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto his Lord. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="76:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="76:31" data-tags="">31</span> | He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath prepared a painful doom. | |
