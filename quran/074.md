| <span id="v1" data-verse="74:1" data-tags="">1</span> | O thou enveloped in thy cloak, | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="74:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Arise and warn! | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="74:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Thy Lord magnify, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="74:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Thy raiment purify, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="74:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Pollution shun! | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="74:6" data-tags="">6</span> | And show not favour, seeking wordly gain! | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="74:7" data-tags="">7</span> | For the sake of thy Lord, be patient! | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="74:8" data-tags="">8</span> | For when the trumpet shall sound, | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="74:9" data-tags="">9</span> | Surely that day will be a day of anguish, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="74:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Not of ease, for disbelievers. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="74:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely, | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="74:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And then bestowed upon him ample means, | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="74:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And sons abiding in his presence | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="74:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And made (life) smooth for him. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="74:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Yet he desireth that I should give more. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="74:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Nay! For lo! he hath been stubborn to Our revelations. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="74:17" data-tags="">17</span> | On him I shall impose a fearful doom. | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="74:18" data-tags="">18</span> | For lo! he did consider; then he planned - | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="74:19" data-tags="">19</span> | (Self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="74:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Again (self-)destroyed is he, how he planned! - | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="74:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Then looked he, | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="74:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Then frowned he and showed displeasure. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="74:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Then turned he away in pride | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="74:24" data-tags="">24</span> | And said: This is naught else than magic from of old; | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="74:25" data-tags="">25</span> | This is naught else than speech of mortal man. | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="74:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Him shall I fling unto the burning. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="74:27" data-tags="">27</span> | - Ah, what will convey unto thee what that burning is! - | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="74:28" data-tags="">28</span> | It leaveth naught; it spareth naught | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="74:29" data-tags="">29</span> | It shrivelleth the man. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="74:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Above it are nineteen. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="74:31" data-tags="">31</span> | We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and their number have We made to be a stumbling-block for those who disbelieve; that those to whom the Scripture hath been given may have certainty, and that believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the Scripture hath been given and believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts there is disease, and disbelievers, may say: What meaneth Allah by this similitude ? Thus Allah sendeth astray whom He will, and whom He will He guideth. None knoweth the hosts of thy Lord save Him. This is naught else than a Reminder unto mortals. | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="74:32" data-tags="">32</span> | Nay, by the Moon | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="74:33" data-tags="">33</span> | And the night when it withdraweth | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="74:34" data-tags="">34</span> | And the dawn when it shineth forth, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="74:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Lo! this is one of the greatest (portents) | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="74:36" data-tags="">36</span> | As a warning unto men, | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="74:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Unto him of you who will advance or hang back. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="74:38" data-tags="">38</span> | Every soul is a pledge for its own deeds; | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="74:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Save those who will stand on the right hand. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="74:40" data-tags="">40</span> | In gardens they will ask one another | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="74:41" data-tags="">41</span> | Concerning the guilty: | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="74:42" data-tags="">42</span> | What hath brought you to this burning ? | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="74:43" data-tags="">43</span> | They will answer: We were not of those who prayed | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="74:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Nor did we feed the wretched. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="74:45" data-tags="">45</span> | We used to wade (in vain dispute) with (all) waders, | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="74:46" data-tags="">46</span> | And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="74:47" data-tags="">47</span> | Till the Inevitable came unto us. | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="74:48" data-tags="">48</span> | The mediation of no mediators will avail them then. | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="74:49" data-tags="">49</span> | Why now turn they away from the Admonishment, | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="74:50" data-tags="">50</span> | As they were frightened asses | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="74:51" data-tags="">51</span> | Fleeing from a lion ? | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="74:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Nay, but everyone of them desireth that he should be given open pages (from Allah). | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="74:53" data-tags="">53</span> | Nay, verily. They fear not the Hereafter. | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="74:54" data-tags="">54</span> | Nay, verily. Lo! this is an Admonishment. | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="74:55" data-tags="">55</span> | So whosoever will may heed. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="74:56" data-tags="">56</span> | And they will not heed unless Allah willeth (it). He is the fount of fear. He is the fount of Mercy. | |
