> <span id="v1">1</span> Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,
> <span id="v2">2</span> The King of mankind,
> <span id="v3">3</span> The God of mankind,

This Surah presents Islam’s understanding of spiritual danger and divine refuge in its most distilled form. It rightly recognizes that evil operates not only through outward acts but through inward suggestion, an insight that resonates with the biblical portrayal of temptation as a matter of the heart (cf. James 1:14). Its repeated appeal to God as Lord, King, and God of mankind emphasizes divine sovereignty and authority, underscoring humanity’s dependence upon God for protection against unseen spiritual forces. In this respect, the surah reflects a serious moral realism often absent from secular accounts of evil.

((114:1, Refuge, Lord of mankind))
((114:2, King of mankind))
((114:3, God of mankind))

> <span id="v4">4</span> From the evil of the sneaking whisperer,
> <span id="v5">5</span> Who whispers in the hearts of mankind,
> <span id="v6">6</span> Of the jinn and of mankind.

Yet, from a Christian theological standpoint, the surah’s understanding of the human condition remains incomplete. Evil is portrayed primarily as an external intrusion — "**the sneaking whisperer, who whispers in the hearts of mankind**" (v. 5) — rather than as the outworking of a fallen nature in need of redemption. Scripture locates temptation not merely in satanic suggestion but in humanity’s internal corruption after the Fall (Romans 5:12; Jeremiah 17:9). The prayer seeks refuge from influence but does not address guilt, reconciliation, or transformation. Notably absent is any concept of mediation or atonement; the believer is instructed to flee to God’s power, but not to be restored to God’s holiness. Thus, while Surah 114 offers a theology of protection, Christianity insists that protection alone is insufficient without salvation - a salvation Christians believe is accomplished through Christ, the mediator who not only silences the whisperer but renews the heart itself (Hebrews 9:14).
