> <span id="v1">1</span> By the night enshrouding

> <span id="v2">2</span> And the day resplendent

> <span id="v3">3</span> And Him Who has created male and female,

> <span id="v4">4</span> See! your effort is dispersed (toward many ends).

> <span id="v5">5</span> As for him who gives and is dutiful (toward Allah)

> <span id="v6">6</span> And believeth in goodness;

> <span id="v7">7</span> Surely We will ease his way to the state of ease.

> <span id="v8">8</span> But as for him who hoardeth and deemeth himself independent,

> <span id="v9">9</span> And disbelieveth in goodness;

> <span id="v10">10</span> Surely We will ease his way to adversity.

> <span id="v11">11</span> His riches will not save him when he perisheth.

> <span id="v12">12</span> See! Ours it is (to give) the guidance

> <span id="v13">13</span> And see! to Us belong the latter portion and the former.

> <span id="v14">14</span> Therefore have I warned you of the flaming Fire

> <span id="v15">15</span> Which only the most wretched must endure,

> <span id="v16">16</span> He who denies and turneth away.

> <span id="v17">17</span> Far removed from it will be the righteous

> <span id="v18">18</span> Who gives his wealth that he may grow (in goodness).

> <span id="v19">19</span> And none has with him any favour for reward,

> <span id="v20">20</span> Except as seeking (to fulfil) the purpose of his Lord Most High.

> <span id="v21">21</span> He verily will be content.
