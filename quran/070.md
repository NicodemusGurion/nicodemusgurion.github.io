| <span id="v1">1</span> | A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel, | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | (Whereby) the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the span is fifty thousand years. | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | But be patient (O Muhammad) with a patience fair to see. | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | Lo! they behold it afar off | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | While we behold it nigh: | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | The day when the sky will become as molten copper, | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | And the hills become as flakes of wool, | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | Though they will be given sight of them. The guilty man will long to be able to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | And his spouse and his brother | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | And his kin that harboured him | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | And all that are in the earth, if then it might deliver him. | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell | |
| <span id="v16">16</span> | Eager to roast; | |
| <span id="v17">17</span> | It calleth him who turned and fled (from truth), | |
| <span id="v18">18</span> | And hoarded (wealth) and withheld it. | |
| <span id="v19">19</span> | Lo! man was created anxious, | |
| <span id="v20">20</span> | Fretful when evil befalleth him | |
| <span id="v21">21</span> | And, when good befalleth him, grudging; | |
| <span id="v22">22</span> | Save worshippers. | |
| <span id="v23">23</span> | Who are constant at their worship | |
| <span id="v24">24</span> | And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged | |
| <span id="v25">25</span> | For the beggar and the destitute; | |
| <span id="v26">26</span> | And those who believe in the Day of Judgment, | |
| <span id="v27">27</span> | And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom - | |
| <span id="v28">28</span> | Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure - | |
| <span id="v29">29</span> | And those who preserve their chastity | |
| <span id="v30">30</span> | Save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess, for thus they are not blameworthy; | |
| <span id="v31">31</span> | But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors; | |
| <span id="v32">32</span> | And those who keep their pledges and their covenant, | |
| <span id="v33">33</span> | And those who stand by their testimony | |
| <span id="v34">34</span> | And those who are attentive at their worship. | |
| <span id="v35">35</span> | These will dwell in Gardens, honoured. | |
| <span id="v36">36</span> | What aileth those who disbelieve, that they keep staring toward thee (O Muhammad), open-eyed, | |
| <span id="v37">37</span> | On the right and on the left, in groups ? | |
| <span id="v38">38</span> | Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight ? | |
| <span id="v39">39</span> | Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from what they know. | |
| <span id="v40">40</span> | But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising-places and the setting-places of the planets that We verily are Able | |
| <span id="v41">41</span> | To replace them by (others) better than them. And we are not to be outrun. | |
| <span id="v42">42</span> | So let them chat and play until they meet their Day which they are promised, | |
| <span id="v43">43</span> | The day when they come forth from the graves in haste, as racing to a goal, | |
| <span id="v44">44</span> | With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying them: Such is the Day which they are promised. | |
