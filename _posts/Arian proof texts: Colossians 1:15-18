Colossians 1:15-18 is one of the most popular scriptures among Arians such as the Jehovah's Witnesses. But it is also the most misunderstood by the same.

Let's see the whole passage:

> Colossians 1:15-18 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 16 For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things were created through him and for him. 17 And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.

Firstborn
---------

The word that seems to trip up everyone who misunderstand this passage is the word "firstborn". The argument goes "Aha! See! It says first**born**. That means Jesus is created!"

### There are two immediate problems with this.

#### First of all, being born does not mean being created. Being born and being created are two different things.

**Being born or begotten** mean that you are generated through procreative means from parents, and it means that you share the same essence as your parents. Dogs beget dogs, cats beget cats, humans beget humans. So if someone is born of or begotten of Deity, it would also mean that that person is Deity.

**Create** is different. That's when you take some raw material and fashion it into a thing that is different than you in essence. Humans don't create babies, but they create airplanes, houses, mobile phones and french toast.

#### Secondly. No one uses the word "firstborn" to convey the meaning that someone is born.

If an ancient Jewish man asked a father "Is this your firstborn son?" he does not mean "Are you sure that this child was actually born?" What he means is "Is this the one who will inherit most of your estate, and who is prominent over the other sons?"

So calling Jesus "the firstborn" does neither mean that he is created, nor that he is born.

### What "firstborn" mean

In ancient oriental cultures, "firstborn" was a title of prominence in a household. It was the title of the son (or daughter) who was most prominent among all the children. According to custom the firstborn would inherit a larger portion of the wealth, and also carry on the name and legacy of the father of the family. The term **originates** in the fact that **usually** this title was by default bestowed upon the son that was born first. But the title doesn't necessarily mean "born first". In fact the Bible consistently makes a point of showing that the one being born first is passed over in favor of a younger sibling who receives the honor as firstborn instead. Examples include but are not limited to:

- Abel is more prominent than Cain.
- Shem is listed before Japheth.
- Abraham is listed before Nahor and Haran.
- Isaac is the Firstborn and calle the only son of Abraham, even though Ishmael was born first.
- Jacob bought the firstborn rights from Esau.
- Joseph (son #11) was given the privilege of being the firstborn on Jacobs deathbed.
- Josephs younger son Ephraim was blessed as firstborn before Manasseh.
- Judah (son #4) was predicted to be the most prominent tribe from which the Messiah would come.
- Judah's wife Tamar has twins, and one of them, Zerah, put his hand out of the womb, and the midwife tied a scarlet thread around it saying "This one came out first". But in a twist of fate the other son, Perez, came out before him. Though Zerah was considered to have "come out first", Perez got the firstborn blessing of being in the messianic line.
- In 1 Chronicles 26:10 Hosah appoints a younger son named Shimri to be the firstborn.
- Moses was the youngest son in his house but he became the leader over his older siblings.
- In Numbers 3:12,13 God says that he has taken the Levites instead of the firstborn of Israel. This shows that the position as firstborn can be transfered to another person.
- David was the youngest of 7 sons, yet he was anointed as king. Psalm 89:27 says God appointed David as firstborn of all kings of the earth. Yet he was not older than all of them nor even related to them.
- In Exodus 4:22, God calls the nation of Israel his firstborn. However the nation was not born, neither was it the first nation to ever exist. But it was the most prominent nation in the eyes of God.

The list goes on but these examples should suffice to show that "firstborn" does not mean that someone is born, nor necessarily that they are first in chronological order, but rather that they are the most prominent one.

Whenever you see the word "firstborn", replace it with "prince", "ruler", "boss", "VIP" or "most prominent person" and you get the right meaning.

### In Colossians 1:15

Firstborn can describe either priority in time or supremacy in rank. As Paul used it here, he probably had both ideas in mind, with Jesus being before all created things and Jesus being of a supremely different order than all created things. In no way does the title firstborn indicate that Jesus is less than God. In fact, the ancient Rabbis called Jehovah Himself “Firstborn of the World” (Rabbi Bechai).

So when Colossians 1:15 says that Jesus is "the firstborn of all creation" what you should read is "the prince of all creation". Then you get the correct meaning.

It does **not** mean that he that he is the first in the category of created beings, nor that he even belongs to that group. The meaning **must** harmonize with the following verses. And as the following verses show, Jesus is **not** created, but is the uncreated creator of all things.

The "other" deception
---------------------

The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society have published a bible translation called the "New World Translation". [In it they take it upon themselves to "correct" the bible text in many places.](https://thyreon.com/changes-in-the-new-world-translation/) And Colossians 1:16, 17, 20 is one of their worst offenses. ((Verse 20: "and through him to reconcile to himself all **other** things by making peace through the blood he shed on the torture stake, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens."))

> 16 because by means of him all **other** things were created in the heavens and on the earth, ... All **other** things have been created through him and for him. 17 Also, he is before all **other** things, and by means of him all **other** things were made to exist... 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all **other** things...

When the New World Translation writes "all other things" they translate the Greek word "πάντα" (panta/panton). The problem is that panta does not mean "all **other** things". Panta just means "all things". Not "all **other** things".

If you look in the Kingdom Interlinear Translation their own word choice for panta is "all (things)". The word "other" does not exist in the original bible text. In this short passage the Watchtower has inserted the word "other" 5 times with no justification.

The reason for this is that what this passage is saying it that "Jesus created all things, and is before all things, and holds together all things." This tells us that:

1. Jesus is not created.
2. Jesus is eternal.
3. Jesus is almighty.

This goes straight against the doctrines of the Watchtower which teach that Jesus *is* created, is *not* eternal and is *not* almighty. So what do they do to deceive their readers?

If it says Jesus created "all things" then it means he is not in the category of "created beings", so he can't be a created being. But if you add the word "other" to make it say "all **other** things", then what you are saying is that "Jesus created all **other** things **but** himself, because he was created by God." And that is the polar opposite of what the text actually says. So by adding this word they twist and invert the meaning of this passage.

Rather than honestly and humbly changing their doctrines to fit the Bible, they deceitfully and presumptuously change their Bible to fit their doctrines.

It seems they forgot to do this in John 1:3.

> **All things** came into existence through him, and **apart from him not even one thing** came into existence \[that\] has come into existence.

It emphasizes that there exists **no** thing that was **not** created by Jesus. Every single last thing was created by him. No exceptions.

What the passage means, step by step.
-------------------------------------

> He is the image of the invisible God

Being the image of something means the visual representation of it. So while God the Father is invisible, The Son Jesus came as the visual representation of God the Father. In other words, if you see Jesus, you see God. If you were to be blessed with a vision of God, whom you would see would be Jesus.

> the firstborn of all creation.

He is the prince and ruler of all creation.

> For by him all things were created

He is the creator of all things. Every creation that exists was created by Jesus.

> in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

This includes both the heavenly spiritual realm and its beings as well as the physical earthly realm and its beings. Visible things and invisible things. No exception. All things were created by Jesus.

> whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities-

These are ranks of spirit beings. The Colossian congregation seemed to have been preoccupied with an elaborate angelology, which effectively placed angels as mediators between God and man. Paul here emphasized that whatever ranks of spirit beings there may be, Jesus created them all and they all ultimately answer to Him.

> all things were created through him and for him.

Again, Jesus created all things, and he did so for himself.

> And he is before all things, ... He is the beginning

Arius claimed that Jesus was not truly God and that there was a time when He did not exist. Paul rightly understood and insisted that Jesus is before all things, both space and time, and is Himself the beginnig or origin of all things. Jesus exists beyond time. The only one who can exist beyond time is God.

> and in him all things hold together.

The idea is that Jesus is both the unifying principle and the personal sustainer of all creation. This means that every atom in the universe is sustained in existence by Jesus. There is no greater power than this. This is what it means to be almighty. See also Hebrews 1:3.

> And he is the head of the body, the church.

This describes Jesus’ relationship to the church. Here, head probably refers to Jesus’ role as source of the church, even as we refer to the head of a river. And it could also refer to him as the leader of it.

> the firstborn from the dead

Jesus is not the first who died nor the first to be resurrected, but he is the most prominent one because of what his resurrection accomplished. This is another example that firstborn means prominent.

> that in everything he might be preeminent.

Everything in these verses emphasize the preeminence of Jesus. He is the visual representation of God, the prince of creation, the creator of all things, both spiritual and physical, he is eternal and has always existed, he is almighty, upholding everything, the originator and leader of the church, the Kingdom of God and his death and resurrection was the most important event in history.

Anyone who understands what this means ought to be moved to awe and worship of God.

To allow a false understanding of one single word (and the deceptive editing of one deceptive American publishing company) to fool you into denying the divinity of Christ will be the worst mistake you ever make.
