## Mohammed married a 6 year old girl and "consummated" the marriage when she was 9 years old {#pedophile}

[Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

## Muhammad was flabbergasted that other men were not pedophiles

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

The fact that other men are not drawn to sexually abuse children makes Muhammad shocked.

## Quran verses promoting violence

[Surah 3:151-152](https://quran.com/3/151-152)

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …



[Surah 4:89](https://quran.com/4/89)

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

[Surah 4:91](https://quran.com/4/91)

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

[Surah 8:12](https://quran.com/8/12)

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

[Surah 47:4](https://quran.com/47/4?translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…
