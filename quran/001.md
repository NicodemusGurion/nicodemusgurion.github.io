The first chapter of the Quran starts out easy, with just 6 verses. 

> <span id="v1">1</span> In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

It starts out with an introduction of the main character, Allah. Right out the gate no expense is spared on bombastic praise.

((1:1, Allah, Merciful, Benificent))

> <span id="v2">2</span> Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, 

It appears this "Allah" is some intergalactic warlord.

((1:2,Allah,Lord of the worlds))


> <span id="v3">3</span> The Beneficent, the Merciful. 

Unnecessary repetition. You will see a lot of this.

((1:3, Allah, Merciful, Benificent))


> <span id="v4">4</span> Master of the Day of Judgment,

This Allah is apparently a judge as well as a cosmic warlord.

((1:4, Day of judgment))

> <span id="v5">5</span> Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help.

> <span id="v6">6</span> Show us the straight path,
> <span id="v7">7</span> The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray. 

((1:6, Straight path)) ((1:7, Anger of Allah))
