> <span id="v1">1</span> Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate,

> <span id="v2">2</span> And eased thee of the burden

> <span id="v3">3</span> Which weighed down thy back;

> <span id="v4">4</span> And exalted thy fame ?

> <span id="v5">5</span> But lo! with hardship goeth ease,

> <span id="v6">6</span> Lo! with hardship goeth ease;

> <span id="v7">7</span> So when thou art relieved, still toil

> <span id="v8">8</span> And strive to please thy Lord.
