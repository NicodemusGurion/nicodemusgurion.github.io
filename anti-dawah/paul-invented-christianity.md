Claim: Paul invented Christianity and taught a religion Jesus never taught.

Why it’s false:

Paul explicitly affirms he received the gospel from the earliest apostles (Gal. 1–2), and his teachings align with the earliest Christian creeds (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15:3–5), which predate his letters. All major New Testament scholars — Christian, agnostic, or atheist — recognize that the resurrection message and high Christology existed before Paul’s ministry.
