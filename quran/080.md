| <span id="v1">1</span> | He frowned and turned away | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | Because the blind man came unto him. | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | What could inform thee but that he might grow (in grace) | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | Or take heed and so the reminder might avail him ? | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | As for him who thinketh himself independent, | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | Unto him thou payest regard. | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace). | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | And hath fear, | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | From him thou art distracted. | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment, | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | So let whosoever will pay heed to it, | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | On honoured leaves | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | Exalted, purified, | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | (Set down) by scribes | |
| <span id="v16">16</span> | Noble and righteous. | |
| <span id="v17">17</span> | Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful! | |
| <span id="v18">18</span> | From what thing doth He create him ? | |
| <span id="v19">19</span> | From a drop of seed. He createth him and proportioneth him, | |
| <span id="v20">20</span> | Then maketh the way easy for him, | |
| <span id="v21">21</span> | Then causeth him to die, and burieth him; | |
| <span id="v22">22</span> | Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life. | |
| <span id="v23">23</span> | Nay, but (man) hath not done what He commanded him. | |
| <span id="v24">24</span> | Let man consider his food: | |
| <span id="v25">25</span> | How We pour water in showers | |
| <span id="v26">26</span> | Then split the earth in clefts | |
| <span id="v27">27</span> | And cause the grain to grow therein | |
| <span id="v28">28</span> | And grapes and green fodder | |
| <span id="v29">29</span> | And olive-trees and palm-trees | |
| <span id="v30">30</span> | And garden-closes of thick foliage | |
| <span id="v31">31</span> | And fruits and grasses: | |
| <span id="v32">32</span> | Provision for you and your cattle. | |
| <span id="v33">33</span> | But when the Shout cometh | |
| <span id="v34">34</span> | On the day when a man fleeth from his brother | |
| <span id="v35">35</span> | And his mother and his father | |
| <span id="v36">36</span> | And his wife and his children, | |
| <span id="v37">37</span> | Every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless (of others). | |
| <span id="v38">38</span> | On that day faces will be bright as dawn, | |
| <span id="v39">39</span> | Laughing, rejoicing at good news; | |
| <span id="v40">40</span> | And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them, | |
| <span id="v41">41</span> | Veiled in darkness, | |
| <span id="v42">42</span> | Those are the disbelievers, the wicked. | |
