> <span id="v1">1</span> By the fig and the olive,

> <span id="v2">2</span> By Mount Sinai,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And by this land made safe;

> <span id="v4">4</span> Surely We created man of the best stature

> <span id="v5">5</span> Then we reduced him to the lowest of the low,

> <span id="v6">6</span> Save those who believe and do good works, and theirs is a reward unfailing.

> <span id="v7">7</span> So who henceforward will give the lie to you about the judgment ?

> <span id="v8">8</span> Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges ?
