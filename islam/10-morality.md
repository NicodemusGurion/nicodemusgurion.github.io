# Lying 

## Three situations in which you can lie

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4921 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4921)


> I did not hear the Messenger of Allah making a concession for anything people say falsely except in three matters. The Messenger of Allah would say: I do not count as a liar a man who puts things right between people, saying a word by which he intends only putting things right, and a man who says something in war, and a man who says something to his wife, or a wife who says something to her husband.

In Islam you can lie:

1. To promote peace
2. In war
3. In marriage

These pretty much cover all of the human conditions: peaceful, non-peaceful and close relationships. Since Islam is at constant war with the non-Islamic world, a Muslim is always allowed to lie to a non-Muslim. Even Muslims are allowed to lie to one another to preserve peace, which is probably part of why Dawahists lie to Muslims about everything to keep them being Muslims. You can't even trust your spouse, your closest companion. Besides polygamy, child marriage, easy and prolific divorce, and mutah, this is yet another way Islam perverts and destroys the concept of marriage.

In other words, lying is basically permitted at any and all times for any and all reasons to any and all people, which means that you can never trust a Muslim. A religion that sanctions lying can logically not be the truth. It can only come from the Father of Lies, Satan. (John 8:44)

## You can break an oath if you have a better alternative 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1716](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1716)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better."

Islam is based on lies and dishonesty.





# Racism

## Blacks are worth half as much

Muhammad owned and traded black slaves. The going rate was two black slaves for one Arabic slave. 

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves).


## Black people were created for hell {#blacks-made-for-hell}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 119](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:119)

> …“God created Adam when He created him and struck his right shoulder and brought forth his offspring white like small ants. And he struck his left shoulder and brought forth his offspring black as though they were charcoal. Then He said to the party on his right side, ‘To paradise, and I do not care’ and He said to the party in his left shoulder, ‘To hell, and I do not care’.”

According to Muhammed, white people are destined for heaven and black people are destined for hell.

## Those condemned by Allah turns black {#blackface-hell}

Surah 3:106-107

> on a day when some faces are whitened and some faces are blackened. So as for those whose faces were blackened: “Did you deny after having attained faith?” Then taste the punishment on account of what you used to deny. And as for those whose faces were whitened—(they are) in Allah’s mercy; therein they abide.

## Black people symbolize disease {#black-disease}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7039)

> …I saw in a dream a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling at Mahai'a. I interpreted that as a symbol of the epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a…

When Muhammad sees a black woman in a dream he automatically assumes she represents an epidemic.


## Turks look like their faces were hit with a hammer {#turks}

[Sahih Muslim 2912 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2912d)

> The Last Hour would not come until the Muslims fight with the Turks-a people whose faces would be like hammered shields wearing clothes of hair and walking (with shoes) of hair.

Another description of Turks:

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2928](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2928)

> …The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Turks; people with small eyes, red faces, and flat noses. Their faces will look like shields coated with leather…

## Ethiopians have heads like raisins {#raisin-heads}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 693](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:693)

> "Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin were made your chief."

See also [Sahih al-Bukhari 7142](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7142)

## Muhammad didn't like black dogs {#black-dogs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3205](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3205)

> Were it not that dogs form one of the communities, I would have commanded that they be killed. But kill those that are all black...

## Black dogs are satanic

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> I (one of the narrators)said: "What is the difference between a black dog, a yellow one and a red one?" He said: I asked the Messenger of Allah just like you and he said:"The black dog is a shaitan."






# Sex and rape


## Rape

### Captured women may be freely raped {#raping-captives}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

### Impregnating rape victims is of no concern

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.



## Muslims men can have sex slaves

Surah 4:3 

> If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.

The footnote on quran.com says "A bondwoman is **a female slave** that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war".

A muslim man can freely use his female slaves for sex.

Surah 33:50

> O Prophet! We have **made lawful** for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you... We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession.

"Made lawful" means that he can have sex with female slaves.

Surah 23:5-6; 70:29-30

> [Sucessful are the believers...] those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those [bondswomen] in their possession, for then they are free from blame

This passage says that a muslim should be chaste except with their wives (plural) or "those their right hand posesses", which would be women they have taken captive in war or bought as slaves. It's allowed for muslim men to have slaves that they have sex with and these slave women can not refuse them.

Surah 4:24

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession.

They're not allowed to have sex with married women **except** if these **married women** have been captured in battle. Then it is allowed to have sex with these **married women**.









# Slavery

See also [Muhammad and slavery](#muhammad-and-slavery), [Sex slaves](#sex-slaves)

## Runaway slaves lack protection

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3350](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3350)

> If any slave runs away protection does not apply to him.

Compare to the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:

> “You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

## Value of slaves

[Muwatta Malik Book 20, Hadith 243](https://sunnah.com/urn/409590)

> The value of the newly-born slave is fifty dinars, and that is one-tenth of what the blood-money for the mother would be.

## Black slaves are worth half of Arab slaves {#black-slaves-worth-less}

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves), [Racism](#racism).

## You may flog your slaves (and your wife) {#flog-slaves}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5204](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5204)

> The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."




# Theft


## Plundering is ok if no one is watching

[Sahih al Bukhari 6772](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6772)

> … when a robber robs and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it.…

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3936](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3936)

> …the plunderer, at the time he is plundering with the people looking on, is not a believer.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3935](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3935)

> “Whoever plunders openly is not one of us.”

So plundering only makes a Muslim a nonbeliever under the condition that they do it openly when someone is watching. If it's done in secret it's no problem.



# Violence and Jihad 


See also [Muhammad and violence](/islam/muhammad/#muhammad-and-violence).

## Standing orders to fight the world

### What triggered Jihad {#allah-allows-jihad}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”

When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.


### Fight the unbelievers until they convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 25](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:25)

> Allah's Messenger said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to *fight against the people* until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then *they save their lives and property from me* except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."


[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…

### "Kill unbelievers wherever you find them"

Surah 4:89

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

Surah 4:91

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

### Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47/4?translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…

### Behead unbelievers

Surah 8:12

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.

### Terrorizing and killing unbelievers

Surah 3:151-152

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.



## View on violence and terrorism


### Fighting is the second best deed in Islam

[Sahih al-Bukhari 26](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:26)

> Allah's Messenger was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then asked, "What is the next in goodness? He replied, "To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause."


### Jihadis are rewarded with booty and paradise

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). 

### Those who die for Allah are the best of people

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.


### Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

Surah 4:95

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

### Fighting is obligatory for Muslims 

Surah 2:216

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 

### Muslims not fighting are hypocrites

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3097](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3097)

> "Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy."

### Muslims not fighting for Islam are punished with hell

Surah 8:15-16

> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.


### Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire


## View on those who resist Islamic violence 


### Resisting Islam is severely punished

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


### Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "The institution of Hima (sanctuary)[^hima] is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

[^hima]: In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.
