Claim: Christianity was spread by force; Islam spreads because of truth.

Why it’s false:

Christianity spread across the Roman Empire and the wider world by evangelism long before European colonialism existed. Islam historically spread mainly by military expansion and oppression against non-Muslims. Islam is the only colonial superpower that still exists.
