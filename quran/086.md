> <span id="v1">1</span> By the heaven and the Morning Star

> <span id="v2">2</span> - Ah, what will tell you what the Morning Star is!

> <span id="v3">3</span> - The piercing Star!

> <span id="v4">4</span> No human soul but has a guardian over it.

> <span id="v5">5</span> So let man consider from what he is created.

> <span id="v6">6</span> He is created from a gushing fluid

> <span id="v7">7</span> That issued from between the loins and ribs.

> <span id="v8">8</span> See! He verily is Able to return him (unto life)

> <span id="v9">9</span> On the day when hidden thoughts shall be searched out.

> <span id="v10">10</span> Then will he have no might nor any helper.

> <span id="v11">11</span> By the heaven which giveth the returning rain,

> <span id="v12">12</span> And the earth which splitteth (with the growth of trees and plants)

> <span id="v13">13</span> See! this (Qur'an) is a conclusive word,

> <span id="v14">14</span> It is no pleasantry.

> <span id="v15">15</span> See! they plot a plot (against thee, O Muhammad)

> <span id="v16">16</span> And I plot a plot (against them).

> <span id="v17">17</span> So give a respite to the disbelievers. Deal you gently with them for a while.
