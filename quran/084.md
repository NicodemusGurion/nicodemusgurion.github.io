| <span id="v1" data-verse="84:1" data-tags="">1</span> | When the heaven is split asunder | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="84:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And attentive to her Lord in fear, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="84:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And when the earth is spread out | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="84:4" data-tags="">4</span> | And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="84:5" data-tags="">5</span> | And attentive to her Lord in fear! | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="84:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Thou, verily, O man, art working toward thy Lord a work which thou wilt meet (in His presence). | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="84:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Then whoso is given his account in his right hand | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="84:8" data-tags="">8</span> | He truly will receive an easy reckoning | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="84:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And will return unto his folk in joy. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="84:10" data-tags="">10</span> | But whoso is given his account behind his back, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="84:11" data-tags="">11</span> | He surely will invoke destruction | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="84:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And be thrown to scorching fire. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="84:13" data-tags="">13</span> | He verily lived joyous with his folk, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="84:14" data-tags="">14</span> | He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah). | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="84:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him! | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="84:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="84:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And by the night and all that it enshroudeth, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="84:18" data-tags="">18</span> | And by the moon when she is at the full, | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="84:19" data-tags="">19</span> | That ye shall journey on from plane to plane. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="84:20" data-tags="">20</span> | What aileth them, then, that they believe not | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="84:21" data-tags="">21</span> | And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ? | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="84:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny; | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="84:23" data-tags="">23</span> | And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding. | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="84:24" data-tags="">24</span> | So give them tidings of a painful doom, | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="84:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Save those who believe and do good works, for theirs is a reward unfailing. | |
