This Surah emphasizes the fleeting nature of life. The “time” here is often interpreted as both chronological and moral: the passage of time in which humanity risks loss if they fail in righteousness. This is a Meccan surah.

> <span id="v3">3</span> Save those who believe and do good works, and exhort one another to truth and exhort one another to endurance.
