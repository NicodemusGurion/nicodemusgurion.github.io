Claim: Christians worship three gods — the Trinity is polytheism.

Why it’s false:

Christian monotheism is “complex monotheism”:
- One Being
- Three Persons

This is misunderstood through the Islamic lens of tawhid, but philosophically and historically the doctrine is monotheistic, not polytheistic.
