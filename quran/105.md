> <span id="v1">1</span> Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant ?

> <span id="v2">2</span> Did He not bring their stratagem to naught,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And send against them swarms of flying creatures,

> <span id="v4">4</span> Which pelted them with stones of baked clay,

> <span id="v5">5</span> And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle) ?
