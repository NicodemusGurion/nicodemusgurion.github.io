*Person is claiming that a rapid increase in adherebts means that Islam is true*

Truth is not measured in popularity. If it was, Christianity would still be the true religion for decade to come.

In the last decade, the number of transgender people have increased by approximately 233%, compared to Islam's measly 25%, meaning that according to your assertion, transgenderism is the one true religion, and Islam is false.

The only growth Islam experiences is due to higher than normal birth rates, not conversions. In fact, more people are leaving Islam than joining. 

"Increases in the global Muslim population are largely due to Muslims having a relatively young age structure and high fertility rate, two characteristics that result in natural population growth." https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/09/how-the-global-religious-landscape-changed-from-2010-to-2020/
