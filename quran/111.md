> <span id="v1">1</span> The power of Abu Lahab will perish, and he will perish.

Who is Abu Lahab? The Quran doesn't explain. Unless you already know of the story about him, this Surah is completely meaningless and without context.

Abu Lahab was a relative of Muhammad who opposed his teachings. Muhammad was so petty that he wrote this Surah as a curse, and claimed that Allah revealed it. Thus portraying Allah as being as petty and narcissistic as Muhammad.

((111:1, Abu Lahab, No context, Quran - unclear))

> <span id="v2">2</span> His wealth and gains will not exempt him.

((111:2, Wealth))

> <span id="v3">3</span> He will be plunged in flaming Fire,

((111:3, Hell, Fire))

> <span id="v4">4</span> And his wife, the wood-carrier,

((111:4, Wood carrier))

> <span id="v5">5</span> Will have upon her neck a halter of palm-fibre.

((111:5, Palm))
