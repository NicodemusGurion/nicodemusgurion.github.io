> <span id="v1">1</span> When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake

> <span id="v2">2</span> And Earth yields up her burdens,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And man said: What ails her ?

> <span id="v4">4</span> That day she will relate her chronicles,

> <span id="v5">5</span> Because your Lord inspires her.

> <span id="v6">6</span> That day mankind will issue forth in scattered groups to be shown their deeds.

> <span id="v7">7</span> And whoso doeth good an atom's weight will see it then,

> <span id="v8">8</span> And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight will see it then.
