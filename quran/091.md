| <span id="v1">1</span> | By the sun and his brightness, | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | And the moon when she followeth him, | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | And the day when it revealeth him, | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | And the night when it enshroudeth him, | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | And the heaven and Him Who built it, | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | And the earth and Him Who spread it, | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | And a soul and Him Who perfected it | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | And inspired it (with conscience of) what is wrong for it and (what is) right for it. | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | He is indeed successful who causeth it to grow, | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | And he is indeed a failure who stunteth it. | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | (The tribe of) Thamud denied (the truth) in their rebellious pride, | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | When the basest of them broke forth | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | And the messenger of Allah said: It is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink! | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | But they denied him, and they hamstrung her, so Allah doomed them for their sin and rased (their dwellings). | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | He dreadeth not the sequel (of events). | |
