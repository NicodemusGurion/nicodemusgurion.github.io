| <span id="v1" data-verse="78:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Whereof do they question one another ? | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="78:2" data-tags="">2</span> | (It is) of the awful tidings, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="78:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Concerning which they are in disagreement. | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="78:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Nay, but they will come to know! | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="78:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Nay, again, but they will come to know! | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="78:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Have We not made the earth an expanse, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="78:7" data-tags="">7</span> | And the high hills bulwarks ? | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="78:8" data-tags="">8</span> | And We have created you in pairs, | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="78:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And have appointed your sleep for repose, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="78:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And have appointed the night as a cloak, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="78:11" data-tags="">11</span> | And have appointed the day for livelihood. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="78:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And We have built above you seven strong (heavens), | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="78:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And have appointed a dazzling lamp, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="78:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water, | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="78:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Thereby to produce grain and plant, | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="78:16" data-tags="">16</span> | And gardens of thick foliage. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="78:17" data-tags="">17</span> | Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time, | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="78:18" data-tags="">18</span> | A day when the trumpet is blown and ye come in multitudes, | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="78:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And the heaven is opened and becometh as gates, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="78:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And the hills are set in motion and become as a mirage. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="78:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Lo! hell lurketh in ambush, | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="78:22" data-tags="">22</span> | A home for the rebellious. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="78:23" data-tags="">23</span> | They will abide therein for ages. | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="78:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Therein taste they neither coolness nor (any) drink | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="78:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Save boiling water and a paralysing cold: | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="78:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Reward proportioned (to their evil deeds). | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="78:27" data-tags="">27</span> | For lo! they looked not for a reckoning; | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="78:28" data-tags="">28</span> | They called Our revelations false with strong denial. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="78:29" data-tags="">29</span> | Everything have We recorded in a Book. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="78:30" data-tags="">30</span> | So taste (of that which ye have earned). No increase do We give you save of torment. | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="78:31" data-tags="">31</span> | Lo! for the duteous is achievement - | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="78:32" data-tags="">32</span> | Gardens enclosed and vineyards, | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="78:33" data-tags="">33</span> | And maidens for companions, | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="78:34" data-tags="">34</span> | And a full cup. | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="78:35" data-tags="">35</span> | There hear they never vain discourse, nor lying - | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="78:36" data-tags="">36</span> | Requital from thy Lord - a gift in payment - | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="78:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Lord of the heavens and the earth, and (all) that is between them, the Beneficent; with Whom none can converse. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="78:38" data-tags="">38</span> | On the day when the angels and the Spirit stand arrayed, they speak not, saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth and who speaketh right. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="78:39" data-tags="">39</span> | That is the True Day. So whoso will should seek recourse unto his Lord. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="78:40" data-tags="">40</span> | Lo! We warn you of a doom at hand, a day whereon a man will look on that which his own hands have sent before, and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I were dust!" | |
