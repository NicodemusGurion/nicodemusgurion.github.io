Claim: The Bible portrays prophets committing terrible sins; this proves it is corrupted.”

Why it’s misleading:

The Bible records human frailty *on purpose.* It does not “corrupt prophets”; it documents moral realism to highlight God’s mercy and holiness. Islamic Dawah often assumes prophets must be sinless; this is a theological presupposition not shared by the Bible.
