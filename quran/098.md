> <span id="v1">1</span> Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters could not have left off (erring) till the clear proof came unto them,

> <span id="v2">2</span> A messenger from Allah, reading purified pages

> <span id="v3">3</span> Containing correct scriptures.

> <span id="v4">4</span> Nor were the People of the Scripture divided until after the clear proof came unto them.

> <span id="v5">5</span> And they are ordered nothing else than to serve Allah, keeping religion pure for Him, as men by nature upright, and to establish worship and to pay the poor-due. That is true religion.

> <span id="v6">6</span> See! those who disbelieve, among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters, will abide in fire of hell. They are the worst of created beings.

> <span id="v7">7</span> (And) see! those who believe and do good works are the best of created beings.

> <span id="v8">8</span> Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they dwell for ever. Allah has pleasure in them and they have pleasure in Him. This is (in store) for him who feareth his Lord.
