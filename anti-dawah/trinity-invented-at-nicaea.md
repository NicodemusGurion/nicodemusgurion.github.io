Claim: The Trinity is a later invention from the Council of Nicaea, or by emperor Constantine.

Why it’s false:

The Trinity is rooted in the New Testament’s portrayal of the Father, Son, and Spirit. Early Christian writings long before Nicaea (Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Tertullian) affirm the divinity of Christ and Trinitarian formulations. Nicaea addressed Arianism, not the invention of the doctrine itself.
