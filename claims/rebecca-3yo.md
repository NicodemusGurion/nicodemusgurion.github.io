# Start

Some claim that Rebecca in the Bible was married off to Isaac at the age of 3.

This claim is made to justify the fact that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6 and consummated the marriage when she was 9.[^hadiths]

[^hadiths]: See [Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130), [3896](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3896), [5133](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5133), [5134](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5134), [5158](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5158), [Sahih Muslim 1422c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c), [1422b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422b), [1876](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1876), [1982](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1982), [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4931](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4931), [2121](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121), and [Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378).

If this was true, do you personally think that Isaac was a good moral example?

- Yes, Isaac was morally good # Isaac was good
- No, Isaac was morally despicable # Isaac was despicable

# Isaac was good

If you are ok with middle aged men marrying little girls, then why would you even try to defend Muhammad by bringing up Isaac?

If you were *truly* ok with it, you wouldnâ€™t feel the need to even say anything.

The only reason for you todo it is because you *know* that what Muhammad did is morally evil, but you must hypocritically defend him.

- Yes, I am a hypocritical coward # I am a hypocrite
- No, I really do support and enable pedophilia # I am a pedophile

# I am a hypocrite

I understand that it's hard to be true to yourself when you are the victim of a death cult that threatens to kill you if you don't praise Muhammad. 

But the good news is that you don't need to be! You can start following Jesus instead. Jesus never did anything morally evil. As his follower you will never need to feel like a hypocrite for defending him.

- I would like to reject Muhammad as despicable and start following Jesus instead # Muhammad was despicable

# I am a pedophile

So you are a pedophile or pedophile enabler? That is morally evil, and you will go to hell for it. 

But the good news is that Jesus can save you, and by his power he can reform you into a new, righteous person. All you need to do is reject Muhammad and his pedophile ways as despicable, and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior.

- I would like to reject Muhammad as despicable and start following Jesus instead # Muhammad was despicable


# Isaac was despicable

But if Isaac was a morally despicable man for allegedly marrying Rebecca at age 3, why would you use him to justify that Muhammad married Aisha at age 6, and had sex with her at age 9? 

That only shows that you think Muhammad is comparable to the most despicable man in the Bible.

- Yes, Muhammad was despicable # Muhammad was despicable
- No, Muhammad was a good moral example for marrying a child > /claims/aisha/ 

# Muhammad was despicable

I am glad we agree on the fact that Muhammad was a despicable human being. 

So why not take this opportunity to officially reject him, and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior?

In the presence of witnesses please declare:

> "I reject Muhammad. He was a false prophet and a despicable man who is burning in hell right now. I renounce Islam, and accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Lord Jesus, I believe that you are God. I believe that you came into the world to save sinners. I believe you died on the cross for my sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the grave to defeat death. Please save me and allow me to follow you as my Lord."

And welcome into the family of God!
