| <span id="v1" data-verse="36:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Ya Sin. | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="36:2" data-tags="">2</span> | By the wise Qur'an, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="36:3" data-tags="">3</span> | Lo! thou art of those sent | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="36:4" data-tags="">4</span> | On a straight path, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="36:5" data-tags="">5</span> | A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="36:6" data-tags="">6</span> | That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="36:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them, for they believe not. | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="36:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they are made stiff-necked. | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="36:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have covered them so that they see not. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="36:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they believe not. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="36:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="36:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="36:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from Allah) came unto them; | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="36:14" data-tags="">14</span> | When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="36:15" data-tags="">15</span> | They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught revealed. Ye do but lie! | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="36:16" data-tags="">16</span> | They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="36:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="36:18" data-tags="">18</span> | (The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="36:19" data-tags="">19</span> | They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="36:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried: O my people! Follow those who have been sent! | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="36:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="36:22" data-tags="">22</span> | For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back ? | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="36:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="36:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Then truly I should be in error manifest. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="36:25" data-tags="">25</span> | Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="36:26" data-tags="">26</span> | It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="36:27" data-tags="">27</span> | With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="36:28" data-tags="">28</span> | We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="36:29" data-tags="">29</span> | It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="36:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him! | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="36:31" data-tags="">31</span> | Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them; | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="36:32" data-tags="">32</span> | But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="36:33" data-tags="">33</span> | A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof; | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="36:34" data-tags="">34</span> | And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="36:35" data-tags="">35</span> | That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks ? | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="36:36" data-tags="">36</span> | Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="36:37" data-tags="">37</span> | A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="36:38" data-tags="">38</span> | And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="36:39" data-tags="">39</span> | And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf. | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="36:40" data-tags="">40</span> | It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="36:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="36:42" data-tags="">42</span> | And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="36:43" data-tags="">43</span> | And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can they be saved; | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="36:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="36:45" data-tags="">45</span> | When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="36:46" data-tags="">46</span> | Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn away from it! | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="36:47" data-tags="">47</span> | And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="36:48" data-tags="">48</span> | And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="36:49" data-tags="">49</span> | They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="36:50" data-tags="">50</span> | Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="36:51" data-tags="">51</span> | And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="36:52" data-tags="">52</span> | Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="36:53" data-tags="">53</span> | It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="36:54" data-tags="">54</span> | This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do. | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="36:55" data-tags="">55</span> | Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="36:56" data-tags="">56</span> | They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="36:57" data-tags="">57</span> | Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="36:58" data-tags="">58</span> | The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="36:59" data-tags="">59</span> | But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! | |
| <span id="v60" data-verse="36:60" data-tags="">60</span> | Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo! he is your open foe! - | |
| <span id="v61" data-verse="36:61" data-tags="">61</span> | But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. | |
| <span id="v62" data-verse="36:62" data-tags="">62</span> | Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? | |
| <span id="v63" data-verse="36:63" data-tags="">63</span> | This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). | |
| <span id="v64" data-verse="36:64" data-tags="">64</span> | Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. | |
| <span id="v65" data-verse="36:65" data-tags="">65</span> | This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. | |
| <span id="v66" data-verse="36:66" data-tags="">66</span> | And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? | |
| <span id="v67" data-verse="36:67" data-tags="">67</span> | And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making them powerless to go forward or turn back. | |
| <span id="v68" data-verse="36:68" data-tags="">68</span> | He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? | |
| <span id="v69" data-verse="36:69" data-tags="">69</span> | And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him. This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, | |
| <span id="v70" data-verse="36:70" data-tags="">70</span> | To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers. | |
| <span id="v71" data-verse="36:71" data-tags="">71</span> | Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the cattle, so that they are their owners, | |
| <span id="v72" data-verse="36:72" data-tags="">72</span> | And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for riding, some for food ? | |
| <span id="v73" data-verse="36:73" data-tags="">73</span> | Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give thanks ? | |
| <span id="v74" data-verse="36:74" data-tags="">74</span> | And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be helped. | |
| <span id="v75" data-verse="36:75" data-tags="">75</span> | It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them a host in arms. | |
| <span id="v76" data-verse="36:76" data-tags="">76</span> | So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they conceal and what proclaim. | |
| <span id="v77" data-verse="36:77" data-tags="">77</span> | Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he is an open opponent. | |
| <span id="v78" data-verse="36:78" data-tags="">78</span> | And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? | |
| <span id="v79" data-verse="36:79" data-tags="">79</span> | Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower of every creation, | |
| <span id="v80" data-verse="36:80" data-tags="">80</span> | Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle from it. | |
| <span id="v81" data-verse="36:81" data-tags="">81</span> | Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, | |
| <span id="v82" data-verse="36:82" data-tags="">82</span> | But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it: Be! and it is. | |
| <span id="v83" data-verse="36:83" data-tags="">83</span> | Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things! Unto Him ye will be brought back. | |
