> <span id="v1">1</span> When the heaven is cleft asunder,

> <span id="v2">2</span> When the planets are dispersed,

> <span id="v3">3</span> When the seas are poured forth,

> <span id="v4">4</span> And the sepulchres are overturned,

> <span id="v5">5</span> A soul will know what it has sent before (it) and what left behind.

> <span id="v6">6</span> O man! What has made you careless concerning your Lord, the Bountiful,

> <span id="v7">7</span> Who created you, then fashioned, then proportioned you ?

> <span id="v8">8</span> Into whatsoever form He will, He casteth you.

> <span id="v9">9</span> No, but you deny the Judgment.

> <span id="v10">10</span> See! there are above you guardians,

> <span id="v11">11</span> Generous and recording,

> <span id="v12">12</span> Who know (all) that you do.

> <span id="v13">13</span> See! the righteous verily will be in delight.

> <span id="v14">14</span> And see! the wicked verily will be in hell;

> <span id="v15">15</span> They will burn therein on the Day of Judgment,

> <span id="v16">16</span> And will not be absent thence.

> <span id="v17">17</span> Ah, what will convey to you what the Day of Judgment is!

> <span id="v18">18</span> Again, what will convey to you what the Day of Judgment is!

> <span id="v19">19</span> A day on which no soul has power at all for any (other) soul. The (absolute) command on that day is Allah's.
