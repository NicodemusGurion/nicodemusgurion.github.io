| <span id="v1" data-verse="83:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Woe unto the defrauders: | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="83:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Those who when they take the measure from mankind demand it full, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="83:3" data-tags="">3</span> | But if they measure unto them or weight for them, they cause them loss. | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="83:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Do such (men) not consider that they will be raised again | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="83:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Unto an Awful Day, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="83:6" data-tags="">6</span> | The day when (all) mankind stand before the Lord of the Worlds ? | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="83:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Nay, but the record of the vile is in Sijjin - | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="83:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is! - | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="83:9" data-tags="">9</span> | A written record. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="83:10" data-tags="">10</span> | Woe unto the repudiators on that day! | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="83:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Those who deny the Day of Judgment | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="83:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Which none denieth save each criminal transgressor, | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="83:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Who, when thou readest unto him Our revelations, saith: (Mere) fables of the men of old. | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="83:14" data-tags="">14</span> | Nay, but that which they have earned is rust upon their hearts. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="83:15" data-tags="">15</span> | Nay, but surely on that day they will be covered from (the mercy of) their Lord. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="83:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Then lo! they verily will burn in hell, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="83:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And it will be said (unto them): This is that which ye used to deny. | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="83:18" data-tags="">18</span> | Nay, but the record of the righteous is in 'Illiyin - | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="83:19" data-tags="">19</span> | Ah, what will convey unto thee what 'Illiyin is! - | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="83:20" data-tags="">20</span> | A written record, | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="83:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Attested by those who are brought near (unto their Lord). | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="83:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Lo! the righteous verily are in delight, | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="83:23" data-tags="">23</span> | On couches, gazing, | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="83:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Thou wilt know in their faces the radiance of delight. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="83:25" data-tags="">25</span> | They are given to drink of a pure wine, sealed, | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="83:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Whose seal is musk - for this let (all) those strive who strive for bliss - | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="83:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And mixed with water of Tasnim, | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="83:28" data-tags="">28</span> | A spring whence those brought near (to Allah) drink. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="83:29" data-tags="">29</span> | Lo! the guilty used to laugh at those who believed, | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="83:30" data-tags="">30</span> | And wink one to another when they passed them; | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="83:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And when they returned to their own folk, they returned jesting; | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="83:32" data-tags="">32</span> | And when they saw them they said: Lo! these have gone astray. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="83:33" data-tags="">33</span> | Yet they were not sent as guardians over them. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="83:34" data-tags="">34</span> | This day it is those who believe who have the laugh of disbelievers, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="83:35" data-tags="">35</span> | On high couches, gazing. | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="83:36" data-tags="">36</span> | Are not the disbelievers paid for what they used to do ? | |
