Claim: Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world, implying that it is therefore true.

Why it’s misleading:
The most recent demographic research (Pew, Gordon-Conwell, etc.) generally shows that:
- Christianity remains the largest and is growing in absolute numbers.
- Islam has high growth in certain regions primarily due to higher birth rates.

Conversion data does not indicate Islam is the fastest-growing; global studies show Christianity gains more converts annually.



# Truth is not determined by popularity

Truth is not measured in popularity. If it was, Christianity would still be the true religion for decade to come.

# Other movements grow faster

In the last decade, the number of transgender people have increased by approximately 233%, compared to Islam's measly 25%, meaning that according to your assertion, transgenderism is the one true religion, and Islam is false.

# Increase is due to birth rates, not conversions 

The only growth Islam experiences is due to higher than normal birth rates, not conversions. In fact, more people are leaving Islam than joining. 

"Increases in the global Muslim population are largely due to Muslims having a relatively young age structure and high fertility rate, two characteristics that result in natural population growth." https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/09/how-the-global-religious-landscape-changed-from-2010-to-2020/
