| <span id="v1" data-verse="26:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Ta. Sin. Mim. | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="26:2" data-tags="">2</span> | These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="26:3" data-tags="">3</span> | It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe not. | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="26:4" data-tags="">4</span> | If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it. | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="26:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="26:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="26:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein ? | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="26:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="26:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="26:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="26:11" data-tags="">11</span> | The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="26:12" data-tags="">12</span> | He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="26:13" data-tags="">13</span> | And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me). | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="26:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="26:15" data-tags="">15</span> | He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="26:16" data-tags="">16</span> | And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="26:17" data-tags="">17</span> | (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="26:18" data-tags="">18</span> | (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="26:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="26:20" data-tags="">20</span> | He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="26:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="26:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="26:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="26:24" data-tags="">24</span> | (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief. | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="26:25" data-tags="">25</span> | (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="26:26" data-tags="">26</span> | He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="26:27" data-tags="">27</span> | (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="26:28" data-tags="">28</span> | He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand. | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="26:29" data-tags="">29</span> | (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners. | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="26:30" data-tags="">30</span> | He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="26:31" data-tags="">31</span> | (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="26:32" data-tags="">32</span> | Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="26:33" data-tags="">33</span> | And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="26:34" data-tags="">34</span> | (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard, | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="26:35" data-tags="">35</span> | Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="26:36" data-tags="">36</span> | They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="26:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="26:38" data-tags="">38</span> | So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="26:39" data-tags="">39</span> | And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="26:40" data-tags="">40</span> | (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="26:41" data-tags="">41</span> | And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ? | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="26:42" data-tags="">42</span> | He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). | |
| <span id="v43" data-verse="26:43" data-tags="">43</span> | Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! | |
| <span id="v44" data-verse="26:44" data-tags="">44</span> | Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners. | |
| <span id="v45" data-verse="26:45" data-tags="">45</span> | Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show. | |
| <span id="v46" data-verse="26:46" data-tags="">46</span> | And the wizards were flung prostrate, | |
| <span id="v47" data-verse="26:47" data-tags="">47</span> | Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, | |
| <span id="v48" data-verse="26:48" data-tags="">48</span> | The Lord of Moses and Aaron. | |
| <span id="v49" data-verse="26:49" data-tags="">49</span> | (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one. | |
| <span id="v50" data-verse="26:50" data-tags="">50</span> | They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. | |
| <span id="v51" data-verse="26:51" data-tags="">51</span> | Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers. | |
| <span id="v52" data-verse="26:52" data-tags="">52</span> | And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued. | |
| <span id="v53" data-verse="26:53" data-tags="">53</span> | Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, | |
| <span id="v54" data-verse="26:54" data-tags="">54</span> | (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, | |
| <span id="v55" data-verse="26:55" data-tags="">55</span> | And lo! they are offenders against us. | |
| <span id="v56" data-verse="26:56" data-tags="">56</span> | And lo! we are a ready host. | |
| <span id="v57" data-verse="26:57" data-tags="">57</span> | Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, | |
| <span id="v58" data-verse="26:58" data-tags="">58</span> | And treasures and a fair estate. | |
| <span id="v59" data-verse="26:59" data-tags="">59</span> | Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them. | |
| <span id="v60" data-verse="26:60" data-tags="">60</span> | And they overtook them at sunrise. | |
| <span id="v61" data-verse="26:61" data-tags="">61</span> | And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught. | |
| <span id="v62" data-verse="26:62" data-tags="">62</span> | He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. | |
| <span id="v63" data-verse="26:63" data-tags="">63</span> | Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast. | |
| <span id="v64" data-verse="26:64" data-tags="">64</span> | Then brought We near the others to that place. | |
| <span id="v65" data-verse="26:65" data-tags="">65</span> | And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; | |
| <span id="v66" data-verse="26:66" data-tags="">66</span> | And We drowned the others. | |
| <span id="v67" data-verse="26:67" data-tags="">67</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v68" data-verse="26:68" data-tags="">68</span> | And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v69" data-verse="26:69" data-tags="">69</span> | Recite unto them the story of Abraham: | |
| <span id="v70" data-verse="26:70" data-tags="">70</span> | When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? | |
| <span id="v71" data-verse="26:71" data-tags="">71</span> | They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. | |
| <span id="v72" data-verse="26:72" data-tags="">72</span> | He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? | |
| <span id="v73" data-verse="26:73" data-tags="">73</span> | Or do they benefit or harm you ? | |
| <span id="v74" data-verse="26:74" data-tags="">74</span> | They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. | |
| <span id="v75" data-verse="26:75" data-tags="">75</span> | He said: See now that which ye worship, | |
| <span id="v76" data-verse="26:76" data-tags="">76</span> | Ye and your forefathers! | |
| <span id="v77" data-verse="26:77" data-tags="">77</span> | Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, | |
| <span id="v78" data-verse="26:78" data-tags="">78</span> | Who created me, and He doth guide me, | |
| <span id="v79" data-verse="26:79" data-tags="">79</span> | And Who feedeth me and watereth me. | |
| <span id="v80" data-verse="26:80" data-tags="">80</span> | And when I sicken, then He healeth me, | |
| <span id="v81" data-verse="26:81" data-tags="">81</span> | And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), | |
| <span id="v82" data-verse="26:82" data-tags="">82</span> | And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. | |
| <span id="v83" data-verse="26:83" data-tags="">83</span> | My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. | |
| <span id="v84" data-verse="26:84" data-tags="">84</span> | And give unto me a good report in later generations. | |
| <span id="v85" data-verse="26:85" data-tags="">85</span> | And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, | |
| <span id="v86" data-verse="26:86" data-tags="">86</span> | And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. | |
| <span id="v87" data-verse="26:87" data-tags="">87</span> | And abase me not on the day when they are raised, | |
| <span id="v88" data-verse="26:88" data-tags="">88</span> | The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) | |
| <span id="v89" data-verse="26:89" data-tags="">89</span> | Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. | |
| <span id="v90" data-verse="26:90" data-tags="">90</span> | And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). | |
| <span id="v91" data-verse="26:91" data-tags="">91</span> | And hell will appear plainly to the erring. | |
| <span id="v92" data-verse="26:92" data-tags="">92</span> | And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship | |
| <span id="v93" data-verse="26:93" data-tags="">93</span> | Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? | |
| <span id="v94" data-verse="26:94" data-tags="">94</span> | Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers | |
| <span id="v95" data-verse="26:95" data-tags="">95</span> | And the hosts of Iblis, together. | |
| <span id="v96" data-verse="26:96" data-tags="">96</span> | And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: | |
| <span id="v97" data-verse="26:97" data-tags="">97</span> | By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest | |
| <span id="v98" data-verse="26:98" data-tags="">98</span> | When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v99" data-verse="26:99" data-tags="">99</span> | It was but the guilty who misled us. | |
| <span id="v100" data-verse="26:100" data-tags="">100</span> | Now we have no intercessors | |
| <span id="v101" data-verse="26:101" data-tags="">101</span> | Nor any loving friend. | |
| <span id="v102" data-verse="26:102" data-tags="">102</span> | Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! | |
| <span id="v103" data-verse="26:103" data-tags="">103</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! | |
| <span id="v104" data-verse="26:104" data-tags="">104</span> | And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v105" data-verse="26:105" data-tags="">105</span> | Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), | |
| <span id="v106" data-verse="26:106" data-tags="">106</span> | When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v107" data-verse="26:107" data-tags="">107</span> | Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, | |
| <span id="v108" data-verse="26:108" data-tags="">108</span> | So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. | |
| <span id="v109" data-verse="26:109" data-tags="">109</span> | And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v110" data-verse="26:110" data-tags="">110</span> | So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. | |
| <span id="v111" data-verse="26:111" data-tags="">111</span> | They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee ? | |
| <span id="v112" data-verse="26:112" data-tags="">112</span> | He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past) ? | |
| <span id="v113" data-verse="26:113" data-tags="">113</span> | Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; | |
| <span id="v114" data-verse="26:114" data-tags="">114</span> | And I am not (here) to repulse believers. | |
| <span id="v115" data-verse="26:115" data-tags="">115</span> | I am only a plain warner. | |
| <span id="v116" data-verse="26:116" data-tags="">116</span> | They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death). | |
| <span id="v117" data-verse="26:117" data-tags="">117</span> | He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. | |
| <span id="v118" data-verse="26:118" data-tags="">118</span> | Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me. | |
| <span id="v119" data-verse="26:119" data-tags="">119</span> | And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. | |
| <span id="v120" data-verse="26:120" data-tags="">120</span> | Then afterward We drowned the others. | |
| <span id="v121" data-verse="26:121" data-tags="">121</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v122" data-verse="26:122" data-tags="">122</span> | And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v123" data-verse="26:123" data-tags="">123</span> | (The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). | |
| <span id="v124" data-verse="26:124" data-tags="">124</span> | When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v125" data-verse="26:125" data-tags="">125</span> | Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, | |
| <span id="v126" data-verse="26:126" data-tags="">126</span> | So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. | |
| <span id="v127" data-verse="26:127" data-tags="">127</span> | And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v128" data-verse="26:128" data-tags="">128</span> | Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? | |
| <span id="v129" data-verse="26:129" data-tags="">129</span> | And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? | |
| <span id="v130" data-verse="26:130" data-tags="">130</span> | And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? | |
| <span id="v131" data-verse="26:131" data-tags="">131</span> | Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. | |
| <span id="v132" data-verse="26:132" data-tags="">132</span> | Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that ye know, | |
| <span id="v133" data-verse="26:133" data-tags="">133</span> | Hath aided you with cattle and sons. | |
| <span id="v134" data-verse="26:134" data-tags="">134</span> | And gardens and watersprings. | |
| <span id="v135" data-verse="26:135" data-tags="">135</span> | Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. | |
| <span id="v136" data-verse="26:136" data-tags="">136</span> | They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach; | |
| <span id="v137" data-verse="26:137" data-tags="">137</span> | This is but a fable of the men of old, | |
| <span id="v138" data-verse="26:138" data-tags="">138</span> | And we shall not be doomed. | |
| <span id="v139" data-verse="26:139" data-tags="">139</span> | And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v140" data-verse="26:140" data-tags="">140</span> | And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v141" data-verse="26:141" data-tags="">141</span> | (The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) | |
| <span id="v142" data-verse="26:142" data-tags="">142</span> | When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v143" data-verse="26:143" data-tags="">143</span> | Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, | |
| <span id="v144" data-verse="26:144" data-tags="">144</span> | So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. | |
| <span id="v145" data-verse="26:145" data-tags="">145</span> | And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v146" data-verse="26:146" data-tags="">146</span> | Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, | |
| <span id="v147" data-verse="26:147" data-tags="">147</span> | In gardens and watersprings. | |
| <span id="v148" data-verse="26:148" data-tags="">148</span> | And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, | |
| <span id="v149" data-verse="26:149" data-tags="">149</span> | Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? | |
| <span id="v150" data-verse="26:150" data-tags="">150</span> | Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, | |
| <span id="v151" data-verse="26:151" data-tags="">151</span> | And obey not the command of the prodigal, | |
| <span id="v152" data-verse="26:152" data-tags="">152</span> | Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. | |
| <span id="v153" data-verse="26:153" data-tags="">153</span> | They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; | |
| <span id="v154" data-verse="26:154" data-tags="">154</span> | Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. | |
| <span id="v155" data-verse="26:155" data-tags="">155</span> | He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. | |
| <span id="v156" data-verse="26:156" data-tags="">156</span> | And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day. | |
| <span id="v157" data-verse="26:157" data-tags="">157</span> | But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. | |
| <span id="v158" data-verse="26:158" data-tags="">158</span> | So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v159" data-verse="26:159" data-tags="">159</span> | And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v160" data-verse="26:160" data-tags="">160</span> | The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), | |
| <span id="v161" data-verse="26:161" data-tags="">161</span> | When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v162" data-verse="26:162" data-tags="">162</span> | Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, | |
| <span id="v163" data-verse="26:163" data-tags="">163</span> | So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. | |
| <span id="v164" data-verse="26:164" data-tags="">164</span> | And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v165" data-verse="26:165" data-tags="">165</span> | What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, | |
| <span id="v166" data-verse="26:166" data-tags="">166</span> | And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward folk. | |
| <span id="v167" data-verse="26:167" data-tags="">167</span> | They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. | |
| <span id="v168" data-verse="26:168" data-tags="">168</span> | He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. | |
| <span id="v169" data-verse="26:169" data-tags="">169</span> | My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. | |
| <span id="v170" data-verse="26:170" data-tags="">170</span> | So We saved him and his household, every one, | |
| <span id="v171" data-verse="26:171" data-tags="">171</span> | Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. | |
| <span id="v172" data-verse="26:172" data-tags="">172</span> | Then afterward We destroyed the others. | |
| <span id="v173" data-verse="26:173" data-tags="">173</span> | And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned. | |
| <span id="v174" data-verse="26:174" data-tags="">174</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v175" data-verse="26:175" data-tags="">175</span> | And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v176" data-verse="26:176" data-tags="">176</span> | The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), | |
| <span id="v177" data-verse="26:177" data-tags="">177</span> | When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? | |
| <span id="v178" data-verse="26:178" data-tags="">178</span> | Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, | |
| <span id="v179" data-verse="26:179" data-tags="">179</span> | So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. | |
| <span id="v180" data-verse="26:180" data-tags="">180</span> | And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. | |
| <span id="v181" data-verse="26:181" data-tags="">181</span> | Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). | |
| <span id="v182" data-verse="26:182" data-tags="">182</span> | And weigh with the true balance. | |
| <span id="v183" data-verse="26:183" data-tags="">183</span> | Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth. | |
| <span id="v184" data-verse="26:184" data-tags="">184</span> | And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old. | |
| <span id="v185" data-verse="26:185" data-tags="">185</span> | They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; | |
| <span id="v186" data-verse="26:186" data-tags="">186</span> | Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. | |
| <span id="v187" data-verse="26:187" data-tags="">187</span> | Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. | |
| <span id="v188" data-verse="26:188" data-tags="">188</span> | He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. | |
| <span id="v189" data-verse="26:189" data-tags="">189</span> | But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. | |
| <span id="v190" data-verse="26:190" data-tags="">190</span> | Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. | |
| <span id="v191" data-verse="26:191" data-tags="">191</span> | And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v192" data-verse="26:192" data-tags="">192</span> | And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, | |
| <span id="v193" data-verse="26:193" data-tags="">193</span> | Which the True Spirit hath brought down | |
| <span id="v194" data-verse="26:194" data-tags="">194</span> | Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, | |
| <span id="v195" data-verse="26:195" data-tags="">195</span> | In plain Arabic speech. | |
| <span id="v196" data-verse="26:196" data-tags="">196</span> | And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. | |
| <span id="v197" data-verse="26:197" data-tags="">197</span> | Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? | |
| <span id="v198" data-verse="26:198" data-tags="">198</span> | And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, | |
| <span id="v199" data-verse="26:199" data-tags="">199</span> | And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. | |
| <span id="v200" data-verse="26:200" data-tags="">200</span> | Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. | |
| <span id="v201" data-verse="26:201" data-tags="">201</span> | They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, | |
| <span id="v202" data-verse="26:202" data-tags="">202</span> | So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. | |
| <span id="v203" data-verse="26:203" data-tags="">203</span> | Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? | |
| <span id="v204" data-verse="26:204" data-tags="">204</span> | Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? | |
| <span id="v205" data-verse="26:205" data-tags="">205</span> | Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, | |
| <span id="v206" data-verse="26:206" data-tags="">206</span> | And then cometh that which they were promised, | |
| <span id="v207" data-verse="26:207" data-tags="">207</span> | (How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? | |
| <span id="v208" data-verse="26:208" data-tags="">208</span> | And We destroyed no township but it had its warners | |
| <span id="v209" data-verse="26:209" data-tags="">209</span> | For reminder, for We never were oppressors. | |
| <span id="v210" data-verse="26:210" data-tags="">210</span> | The devils did not bring it down. | |
| <span id="v211" data-verse="26:211" data-tags="">211</span> | It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, | |
| <span id="v212" data-verse="26:212" data-tags="">212</span> | Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. | |
| <span id="v213" data-verse="26:213" data-tags="">213</span> | Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. | |
| <span id="v214" data-verse="26:214" data-tags="">214</span> | And warn thy tribe of near kindred, | |
| <span id="v215" data-verse="26:215" data-tags="">215</span> | And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. | |
| <span id="v216" data-verse="26:216" data-tags="">216</span> | And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do. | |
| <span id="v217" data-verse="26:217" data-tags="">217</span> | And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v218" data-verse="26:218" data-tags="">218</span> | Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) | |
| <span id="v219" data-verse="26:219" data-tags="">219</span> | And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). | |
| <span id="v220" data-verse="26:220" data-tags="">220</span> | Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. | |
| <span id="v221" data-verse="26:221" data-tags="">221</span> | Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? | |
| <span id="v222" data-verse="26:222" data-tags="">222</span> | They descend on every sinful, false one. | |
| <span id="v223" data-verse="26:223" data-tags="">223</span> | They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. | |
| <span id="v224" data-verse="26:224" data-tags="">224</span> | As for poets, the erring follow them. | |
| <span id="v225" data-verse="26:225" data-tags="">225</span> | Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, | |
| <span id="v226" data-verse="26:226" data-tags="">226</span> | And how they say that which they do not ? | |
| <span id="v227" data-verse="26:227" data-tags="">227</span> | Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned! | |
