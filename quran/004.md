Surah 4:34

> The men are protectors of the women because Allah has bestowed some of them over others and because their spend from their wealth. So the righteous women are obedient, guarding the unseen, that which Allah orders them to guard. And those from whom you fear insubordination, exort them, abandon them in bed and beat them. Then if they obey, don't seek a way against them. Indeed Allah is most high.
