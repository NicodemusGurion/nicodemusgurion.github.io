# Muhammad's appearance

What did he look like?

An average looking fellow, neither tall nor short, with wavy hair, silver white skin, yellow beard, eyeliner and mascara, gap tooth and one tooth knocked out.

![Rendition of Muhammad according to the descriptions found in the Hadiths](https://i.ibb.co/jht9dgr/D9540539-7-CC1-4-F7-E-95-C7-D7-C4536-F5378.jpg)

## Muhammad was very average looking {#average-looks}

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3623](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3623)


> The Messenger of Allah was not very tall nor was he [very] short, nor was he pale white, nor was he brown, nor was the wave of his hair completely curly nor straight…

## Muhammad had big hands {#big-hands}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5906](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5906)

> The Prophet had big hands


## Muhammad dyed his beard yellow {#yellow-beard}


[Sunan Ibn Majah 3626](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3626)

> I saw the Messenger of Allah dyeing his beard yellow

## Muhammad had a gap tooth

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 15](https://sunnah.com/shamail:15)

> Allah’s Messenger had a gap between the medial pair of teeth. When he spoke, it seemed as if light were emerging from between his middle teeth."

## Muhammad was white 

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4864](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4864)

> Sa’id al-Jariri quoted Abu al-Tufail as saying: I saw the Messenger of Allah. I asked: How did you see him? He said: He was white, good-looking, and when he walked, it looked as if he was descending to a low ground.

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 12](https://sunnah.com/shamail:12)

## Muhammad used mascara and eyeliner {#make-up-tips}

[Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 50](https://sunnah.com/shamail:50)

> Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): "Color the edges of the eyelids with antimony [ithmid], for it clears the vision and makes the eyelashes grow!” He also maintained that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) had a kohl jar from which he used to apply kohl to his eyelashes every night, three times in this [eye],and three times in that.

Muhammad ordained that his followers ought to follow his example and use heavy mascara and eyeliner. He retouched his make-up three times a day. Muhammad also gave make-up tips, saying the best brands were made of antimony, saying that [it made his eyes pop like firecrackers!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eRbxsvz1Jnw)

## Muhammad liked his own face

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 1126](https://sunnah.com/nasai:1126)

> My face has prostrated to the One Who created it and shaped it and shaped it well

## Muhammad had a tooth knocked out

> The face of the Prophet [was] wounded and one of his front teeth [wa]s broken

## Muhammad dressed in drag

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2581](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2581) tells a story about how people only came with gifts and requesting revelations of Muhammad on the days he was staying in Alisha's house. They did this because they knew Aisha was his favorite wife and perhaps he was in a good mood while he was sexually assaulting his child bride. In any case his other wives complained that Aisha was favoured and wanted people to come with gifts when Muhammad was with them too. But Muhammad explains the reason why people only come to him in Aishas house:

> the revelation does not come to me while I am in the garment of another woman except Aisha.

Allah will not give Muhammad any revelations unless he is cross dressing in Aisha's clothes.

Note that Sunnah.com often adds to and changes translations that are too embarrassing, so they have changed the English translation here to read "beds" rather than "woman's garment". But the Arabic is "لاَ تُؤْذِينِي فِي عَائِشَةَ، فَإِنَّ الْوَحْىَ لَمْ يَأْتِنِي، وَأَنَا فِي ثَوْبِ امْرَأَةٍ إِلاَّ عَائِشَةَ ‏" where the words " ثَوْبِ امْرَأَةٍ" means "women's dress", not "bed". But this kind of deception is to be expected because without lies Islam dies.


Deuteronomy 22:5 says “A woman shall not wear a man’s garment, nor shall a man put on a woman’s cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God."


[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 600](https://sunnah.com/adab:600)

> Sa'id ibn al-'As reported that 'Uthman and 'A'isha told him that Abu Bakr asked for permission to come in to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, while he was lying of 'A'isha's bed, wearing 'A'isha's woollen shirt. He gave Abu Bakr permission to enter while he was like that. he gave him what he needed and then Abu Bakr left. Then 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, asked for permission to come in and he gave him permission to come in while he was like that. He gave him what he needed and then 'Umar left. 'Uthman said, "Then I asked for permission to come in and he sat up and told 'A'isha, 'Take your garment.' I told him what I needed and then I left.' 'A'isha asked, 'Messenger of Allah, why did I see that you did not do for Abu Bakr and 'Umar what you did for 'Uthman?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ''Uthman is a modest man and I feared that if I gave him permission to come in while I was in that state he would not tell me what he needed.'"

So here Muhammad is wearing the clothes of Aisha, and even entertaining guests, namely Abu Bakr and Umar. However when Uthman shows up, Muhammad quickly takes off Aishas clothes, and the reason is that Uthman was considered a "modest man" and Muhammad didn't wish to offend him. So Muhammad knew that him wearing these clothes was something offensive and shameful. But as long as he is with his buddies who don't really care about his various perversions, it's all ok.


# Muhammad's character

## Muhammad was illiterate {#illiterate}

Surah 7:158

> So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write

Muslims brag about this for some strange reason. Being illiterate is nothing to brag about. Muhammad wasn't poor, so the only reason  he would not learn to read or write would be because he was either incredibly lazy or a moron.

## Muhammad was gullible

Surah 9:61

> And among them (the hypocrites) there are those who hurt the Prophet and say, “He is just an ear” (that is, he hears and believes everything).

Muhammad was well known among his people as a gullible person who just listened and believed in anything people said.

## Muhammad was a sinner

Surah 40:55; 47:19

> Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And ask forgiveness of thy sin

[Sahih al-Bukhari 744](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:744)

> Allah's Messenger used to keep silent between the Takbir and the recitation of Qur'an and that interval of silence used to be a short one. I said to the Prophet "May my parents be sacrificed for you! What do you say in the pause between Takbir and recitation?" The Prophet said, "I say, 'O Allah! Set me apart from my sins as the East and West are set apart from each other and clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned of dirt. O Allah! Wash off my sins with water, snow and hail.'"

[Sahih al Bukhari 6307](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6307)

> I heard Allah's Messenger saying." By Allah! I ask for forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6368](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6368)

> The Prophet used to say, "O Allah! I seek refuge with You … from all kinds of sins … O Allah! Wash away my sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from all the sins as a white garment is cleansed from the filth, and let there be a long distance between me and my sins, as You made East and West far from each other."

## Muhammad randomly beat people for no reason

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4536](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4536)

> When the Messenger of Allah was distributing something, a man came towards him and bent down on him. The Messenger of Allah struck him with a bough and his face was wounded. The Messenger of Allah said to him: Come and take retaliation. He said: no, I have forgiven, Messenger of Allah!.

## Muhammad was a copycat {#copycat}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5917](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5917)

> The Prophet used to copy the people of the Scriptures in matters in which there was no order from Allah.

Muhammad was not only a caravan robber but a religion robber as well, picking whatever he liked from the Jews and the Christians.

Surah 9:61

> And among them there are those who hurt the Prophet and say, “He is just an ear” (that is, he hears and believes everything).

Muhammad was well known among his people as a gullible person who just listened and believed in anything people said. So when he heard stories from the Jews and Christians that he liked, he plagiarised them and tried to pass it of as his own revelation. 

Surah 25:4

> The disbelievers say, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but a fabrication which he made up with the help of others.”

They were on to something.

Surah 6:25

> ...Even when they come to you arguing with you, those who disbelieve say, "This is not but legends of the former peoples."

His followers being ignorant didn't notice, but the Jews and Christians did and correctly said that these things were nothing new but stories that had been told for close to 600 years.

Here are some of the things he copied:


### Muhammad copied the Lord's Prayer

[Sunan Abi Dawud 3892](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3892)

> I heard the Messenger of Allah say: If any of you is suffering from anything or his brother is suffering, he should say: 
> Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven, 
> holy is Thy name, 
> Thy command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth, as Thy mercy in the heaven, make Thy mercy in the earth; 
> forgive us our sins, and our errors; 
> Thou art the Lord of good men; send down mercy from Thy mercy, and remedy, and remedy from Thy remedy on this pain so that it is healed up.

Apart from Jesus' supplication for daily bread this prayer is suspiciously similar to the Lord's prayer, addressing God in heaven, praising his name, requesting his will be done in heaven and earth, asking forgiveness for sins, and asking deliverance from evil.

> Matthew 6:9-13 Pray then like this: 
> “Our Father in heaven, 
> hallowed be your name. 
> Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 
> *Give us this day our daily bread,*
> and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 
> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

Coincidence? Or plagiarism?

### Muhammad copied Jesus' teachings 

#### The workers if the vineyard

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2269](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2269)

> Allah's Messenger said, "Your example and the example of Jews and Christians is like the example of a man who employed some laborers to whom he said, 'Who will work for me up to midday for one Qirat each?' The Jews carried out the work for one Qirat each; and then the Christians carried out the work up to the Asr prayer for one Qirat each; and now you Muslims are working from the Asr prayer up to sunset for two Qirats each. The Jews and Christians got angry and said, 'We work more and are paid less.' The employer (Allah) asked them, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They replied in the negative. He said, 'That is My Blessing, I bestow upon whomever I wish.' "

This parable attributed to Muhammad is a blatant copy of Jesus' parable in Matthew 20:1-16 where Jesus tells of a vineyard owner who pays the same wage to the workers who worked all day and to the workers who only worked one hour.

#### Final judgment

[Sahih Muslim 2569](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2569)

> Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger as saying:
> Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would say on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam, I was sick but you did not visit Me. He would say: O my Lord; how could I visit Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Thereupon He would say: Didn't you know that such and such servant of Mine was sick but you did not visit him and were you not aware of this that if you had visited him, you would have found Me by him? O son of Adam, I asked food from you but you did not feed Me. He would say: My Lord, how could I feed Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? He said: Didn't you know that such and such servant of Mine asked food from you but you did not feed him, and were you not aware that if you had fed him you would have found him by My side? (The Lord would again say: ) O son of Adam, I asked drink from you but you did not provide Me. He would say: My Lord, how could I provide Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Thereupon He would say: Such and such of servant of Mine asked you for a drink but you did not provide him, and had you provided him drink you would have found him near Me.

This matches Jesus teaching in Matthew 25:31-46, with the difference that Allah is judging a "son of Adam" or "son of Man", whereas in Jesus' version, Jesus **is** the Son of Man, judging humanity.  So by copying this story from the Christians, and saying that the judge is Allah when it is Jesus, Muhammad is admitting that Jesus **is** Allah/God.

### Muhammad copied Paul's writings

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7498](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7498)

> the Prophet said, "Allah said, "I have prepared for My righteous slaves such excellent things as no eye has ever seen, nor an ear has ever heard nor a human heart can ever think of.' "

About 600 years earlier, Paul wrote:

> 1 Corinthians 2:9 But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him”--


## Muhammad cursed an orphan girl to die young {#cursed-orphan}

[Sahih Muslim 2603](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2603)

> Anas b. Malik reported that there was an orphan girl with Umm Sulaim (who was the mother of Anas). Allah's Messenger saw that orphan girl and said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! That slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaim weeping. Umm Sulaim said: O daughter, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle has invoked curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I would never grow in age…

The Bible says that being kind and help orphans in their need is pure and undefiled worship. (James 1:27) 

Even Surah 93:9 says "so as for the orphan, do not oppress them". But Muhammad curses this orphan girl to die young. A young girl, with no mother or father, who is a slave, this girl already has a tough life and Muhammad decides to break her heart and psychologically traumatize her. When asked why, he smiles and says it doesn't matter because she'll go to paradise when she dies anyway. Sick and twisted.


Exodus 22:22 says "You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child."


## Muhammad disdained a blind man

Surah 80:1,2

> The Prophet frowned and turned away when the blind man came to him.

Mark 10:46-42, Luke 18:35-43 and John 9 tells of how Jesus treated blind people. While others may opress them, Jesus calls them to himself and heals them. Muhammad can't heal anyone, but even looks down on the blind with contempt.

Leviticus 19:14 says "You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am the LORD."


## Muhammad did not like poetry {#philistine}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6155](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6155)

> Allah's Messenger; said, "It is better for anyone of you that the inside of his body be filled with pus which may consume his body, than it be filled with poetry."

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 3760](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3760)


## Muhammad didn't practice what he preached {#hypocrite}

[Muhammad said to not pee towards the Qiblah but did so himself](#peeing-qiblah)



## Muhammad almost caused a famine {#caused-famine}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2471](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2471)

> It was narrated from 'Aisha that the Prophet heard some sounds and said: “What is this noise?” They said: “Palm trees that are being pollinated.” He said: “If they did not do that it would be better.” So they did not pollinate them that year, and the dates did not mature properly. they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said: “If it is one of the matters of your religion, then refer to me.”

Muhammad's incompetence caused the harvest to almost fail, yet he had the gall to tell people to consult him.


## Muhammad probably stole a red velvet cloth {#red-velvet}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 3971](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3971)

> Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: The verse "And no Prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" was revealed about a red velvet. When it was found missing on the day of Badr, some people said; Perhaps the Messenger of Allah has taken it. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down "And no prophet could (ever) be false to his trust" to the end of the verse.

After the battle of Badr, the Muslims were dividing up the spoil, and apparently a piece of red velvet cloth was missing. The immediate suspicion of the other Muslim was that Muhammad had stolen it.

You have to wonder why rather than being beyond suspicion, Muhammad was the very first suspect when something was missing?

So to defend himself, ~~Muhammad~~ Allah revealed the verse Surah 3:161:

> It is inconceivable that a prophet would ever dishonestly take something from the battle gains. Anyone who does so will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection, when each soul will be fully repaid for what it has done: no one will be wronged.

So essentially ~~Muhammad~~ Allah says "No, Muhammad is innocent. Trust me bro." But the same all-knowing Allah was unable to point out who the real thief was? That not only did not solve the problem, but rather makes Muhammad look more suspicious. 

Adding to the mystique is the fact that the verse says "Anyone who does so will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection, when each soul will be fully repaid for what it has done". Why does the verse say that the thief would carry the red velvet clothing with him until judgment day?

The same person, Abdullah ibn Abbas, who told is of how everyone suspected Muhammed of stealing the red velvet piece of clothing, also tells us this:

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 1048](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:1048)

> Ibn Abbas narrated: "A red velvet cloth was placed in the grave of the Prophet."

I guess Abdullah Ibn Abbas had his suspicions, since he told both stories of how everyone thought Muhammad stole a red velvet cloak, and gives the detail that Muhammad was buried on top of a red velvet cloak. Is it the same cloak? We'll just have to see if Muhammad "will carry it with him on the Day of Resurrection."

Also [Ash-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah 3](https://sunnah.com/shamail:3) says Muhammad liked to dress in red, so there's that.

## Muhammad killed puppies

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4276](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4276)

> the Messenger of Allah commanded that all dogs be killed, even small dogs.


## Muhammad was a tough guy

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> Had I not found it difficult for my followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred in His cause."

Sure, Moe, if it weren't for the people needing their cult leader, you would have jumped right into the fray, over and over, rather than sending others to their death. You're so tough!

## Muhammad slapped a lady

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5255](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5255)

> We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, "Sit here," and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An- Numan bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, "Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift." She said, "Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?" The Prophet **raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil**. She said, "I seek refuge with Allah from you." He said, "You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, "O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family."


So Muhammad goes to propose marriage to a lady, and she rejects him, saying he is not worthy. Sunnah.com says that he then "raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil", which is a lie.

The Arabic says "يَضَعُ يَدَهُ عَلَيْهَا" which means "he laid hands upon her". The meaning is not entirely clear, but to "lay hands on someone" usually indicates striking them or grasping them roughly.

Since her immediate reaction to his action was to appeal to Allah for protection, "*I seek refuge with Allah from you*", we can surmise that he wasn't exactly "petting" her like a kitten to make her "tranquil". That is a deception by the translators at sunnah.com.

Given what we know about Muhammad, what most likely happened is that the proud piss ant got so offended that he couldn't score another trophy wife that he immediately resorted to violence and slapped her in the face. 



## Muhammad condoned murder {#murder}


[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4070](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4070)


> There was a blind man during the time of the Messenger of Allah who had an Umm Walad by whom he had two sons. She used to slander and defame the Messenger of Allah a great deal, and he would rebuke her, but she would not pay heed, and he would forbid her to do that, but she ignored him. (The blind man said) One night I mentioned the Prophet, and she slandered him. I could not bear it so I went and got a dagger which I thrust into her stomach and leaned upon it, and killed her. In the morning she was found slain. Mention of that was made to the Prophet and he gathered the people and said: "I adjure by Allah; a man over whom I have the right, that he should obey me, and he did what he did, to stand up." The blind man started to tremble and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I am the one who killed her. She was my Umm Walad and she was kind and gentle toward me, and I have two sons like pearls from her, but she used to slander and defame you a great deal. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not pay heed. Finally, I mentioned your name and she slandered you, so I went and got a dagger which I thrust into her stomach, and leaned on it until I killed her. The Messenger of Allah said: "I bear witness that her blood is permissible."

She was a good wife, and he murdered her because he was brainwashed by his cult leader, and his cult leader condoned and approves of this.


# Muhammad spiritual qualifications and prophethood {#prophethood}



## Muhammad sacrificed to pagan gods

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5499](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5499)

> Allah's Messenger said that he met Zaid bin Amr Nufail at a place near Baldah and this had happened before Allah's Messenger received the Divine Inspiration. Allah's Messenger presented a dish of meat to Zaid bin Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said, "I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stonealtars nor do I eat except that on which Allah's Name has been mentioned on slaughtering."

[Zaid ibn Amr Nufayl (died 605) was a monotheist who lived in Mecca shortly before Islam.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Amr)  Muhammad had just come back from sacrificing an animal to the pagan idols, and offered some of the meat to Zaid. Zaid refused, saying he would not eat anything sacrificed to false gods.


## Muhammad couldn't predict technological advances 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1039)

> Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) said, "Keys of the unseen knowledge are five which nobody knows but Allah . . . nobody knows what will happen tomorrow; nobody knows what is in the womb; nobody knows what he will gain tomorrow; nobody knows at what place he will die; and nobody knows when it will rain."

Yes, we can know what is in the womb, and also when it will rain.


## Muhammad couldn't predict Covid-19 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1880](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1880)

> Allah's Messenger said, "There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it."

Muhammad predicted that plagues (epidemic illnesses) would not be able to enter Medina. 

[Turns out he was wrong](https://archive.fo/VQDJH). Perhaps those angels were off duty?


## Muhammad predicted that the last hour would come before a young man grew old

[Sahih Muslim 2952](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2952)

> 'A'isha reported that when the desert Arabs came to Allah's Messenger **they asked about the Last Hour as to when that would come.** And he looked towards the youngest amongst them and said: **If this man lives, he will not be overtaken by old age.** Your hour has come upon you.”

That young man has been dead for way longer than a thousand years, but the last hour didn't come. Muhammad is a false prophet.

> Narrated 'Aisha: None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

When they had menstrual blood stain their garments they would have to clean them with spit.

> Narrated 'Aisha: "One of the wives of Allah's Messenger  joined him in I'tikaf and she noticed blood and yellowish discharge (from her private parts) and put a dish under her when she prayed."

## Muhammad daughter Fatima was denied an inheritance {#daughter-no-inheritance}

Instead they had to go to Abu Bakr to get what they needed to survive as a charity.

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2969](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2969)

> Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin: Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Messenger of Allah  at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Messenger of Allah  said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity). The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.

## The wives of Muhammad were also denied an inheritance. {#wives-no-inheritance}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 2976](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2976)

> Narrated 'Aishah: When the Messenger of Allah  died, the wives of the Prophet  intended to send 'Uthman b. 'Affan to Abu Bakr to ask him their cost of living from (the inheritance of) the Prophet . Thereupon 'Aishah said: Did not the Messenger of Allah  say: We are not inherited. Whatever we leave is sadaqah (charity).

## The wives of Muhammad were denied remarriage {#no-remarriage}

Surah 33:53

> And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.

In the ancient world marriage meant protection for a woman. Being left a widow was very negative. Also being left childless like Aisha was, meant she didn't even have, nor could she ever get children to help her in her old age. Muhammad was really selfish and heartless to leave his wives to fend for themselves just because of his own insecurities.

## The parents of Muhammad are in hell {#parents-in-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 976b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/135)

> Abu Huraira reported: The Apostle of Allah  visited the grave of his mother and he wept, and moved others around him to tears, and said: **I sought permission from my Lord to beg forgiveness for her but it was not granted to me**, and I sought permission to visit her grave and it was granted to me so visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death.

Muhammad was not allowed to ask forgiveness for his mother, meaning Allah will not forgive her, meaning she is in hell.

[Sunan Abu Dawud 4718](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4718)

> Anas said : A man asked : where is my father, Messenger of Allah? He replied! Your father is in Hell. When he turned his back, he said : **My father and your father are in Hell.**

Muhammad's father is in hell.

















# Muhammad and hygiene {#muhammad-hygiene}

## Muhammad was sickly

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5646](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5646)

> Narrated Aisha: I never saw anybody suffering so much from sickness as Allah's Messenger

Maybe that has something to do with him [drinking sewer water](#sewer-water) and [camel urine](#drinking-camel-urine), [licking people's fingers](#licking-hands), and [dipping flies into his drinks](#dip-flies)? 

## Muhammad told his followers to drink sewer water {#sewer-water}

[Sunnan Abu Dawud 67](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:67)

> Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri: I heard that the people asked the Prophet of Allah : Water is brought for you from the well of Buda'ah. It is a well in which dead dogs, menstrual clothes and excrement of people are thrown. The Messenger of Allah  replied: Verily water is pure and is not defiled by anything...

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 520](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:520)

> "We came to a pond in which there was the carcass of a donkey, so we refrained from using the water until the Messenger of Allah came to us and said: 'Water is not made impure by anything.' Then we drank from it and gave it to our animals to drink, and we carried some with us."

To say that water is not defiled by anything, not even the rotting corpses of dogs and donkeys, menstrual waste products and literal feces is insane and unscientific. This unhygienic idea has probably cost the lives of untold numbers of people throughout history.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 328](https://sunnah.com/nasai:328)

> The Messenger of Allah was asked about water and how some animals and carnivorous beasts might drink from it. He said: 'If the water is more than two Qullahs (ca 200 liters), it will not become filthy.'

## Muhammad gargled with dick water {#dick-water}

[Sahih al Bukhari 274](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:274)

> Water was placed for the ablution of Allah's Messenger after Janaba. He poured water with his right hand over his left twice or thrice and then washed his private parts and rubbed his hand on the earth or on a wall twice or thrice and then rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out...

Notice that after washing his private parts he uses the same water to rinse his mouth and nose.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 29](https://sunnah.com/nasai:29)

## Muhammad urinated standing

[Sahih al Bukhari 2471](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2471)

> Narrated Hudhaifa: I saw Allah's Messenger coming to the dumps of some people and urinated there while standing.

It seems that Hudhaifa [contradicts Aisha](#muhammad-urinated-squatting) and that [Muhammad didn't practice what he taught](#no-urinating-standing) and [other Hadiths also contradict.](#muhammad-urinated-standing)

## Muhammad urinated in some weird way

[Sunan Ibn Majah 341](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:341)

> It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: "The Messenger of Allah turned towards a mountain pass and urinated, until I took pity on him because of the way he parted his legs when he urinated."

Why do Muslims consider such information important for their religion?

## Muhammad peed toward the Qiblah {#peeing-qiblah}

Note: [The Qiblah]{#qiblah} is the prayer direction towards the [Kaaba.](#kaaba)

[Sunnan Ibn Majah 325](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:325)

I can imagine this poor girl walking after this old man, rubbing dried up semen stains out of his clothes with her finger nail while he's on his way to the mosque.

You are indeed Allah's Messenger  in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

## Muhammad was paranoid, accusing a child of being a supervillain {#dajjal}

The Dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology who will pretend to be the promised Messiah and later claim to be God, appearing before the Day of Judgment according to the Islamic eschatological narrative. Muhammad harassed, stalked, and spread rumors about a young boy, saying he was this Dajjal, making him depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2930 a, 2931, 169 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2930a)

> [Muhammad went] to Ibn Sayyad … he found him playing with children … Allah's Messenger struck his back with his hands. Allah's Messenger said: Ibn Sayyad, don't you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you [are] the messenger of the unlettered. … 'Umar b. Khattab said: Allah's Messenger, permit me that I should [behead him]. Thereupon Allah's Messenger said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and if he is not that there is no good for you to kill him. 

There was some back and forth banter. But since this boy didn't play along with Muhammad's delusions, Muhammad insinuated that he is the Dajjal.

> after some time Allah's Messenger … went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When [he] went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah's Messenger saw him on a bed with a blanket around him … and Ibn Sayyad's mother saw Allah's Messenger behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said … here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up …

So Muhammed is actually stalking a sleeping young boy, trying to eavesdrop to confirm his suspicion that this boy is a supervillain.

> then [Muhammad] made a mention of the Dajjal and said: …(the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed.…

It would appear that perhaps Ibn Saiyad was one-eyed, because suddenly Muhammad starts spreading a rumour that the Dajjal is one-eyes, and for the rest of his life, Ibn Saiyad had to live with this rumour. Because of this, the boy grew up to be depressed and suicidal.

[Sahih Muslim 2927c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2927c)

> …lbn Saiyad was along with us. … I felt terribly frightend from him as it was said about him that he was the Dajjal. He brought his goods and placed them by my luggage and I said: It is intense heat. Would you not place that under that tree? And he did that. Then there appeared before us a flock of sheep. He went and brought a cup of milk and said: Abu Said, drink that. I said it is intense heat and the milk is also hot (whereas the fact was) that I did not like to drink from his hands or to take it from his hand and he said: Abu Said, I think that I should take a rope and suspend it by the tree and then commit suicide because of the talks of the people…

Abu Said, like most people, were afraid of Ibn Saiyad because of the rumor started by Muhammad, so he tried to avoid him. Ibn Saiyad, having been ostracized like that his whole life said that it made him want to hang himself.

> I said: "Don't you have a Shaitan?" He said: "Yes, but Allah helped me with him, so he submitted."

## Muhammad believed he had a wrestling match with Satan {#wrestling-satan}

[Sahih al Bukhari 1210](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1210)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, "Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

## Muhammad was commanded by jinns

[Sahih Muslim 2814 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2814a)

> Allah's Messenger said: There is none amongst you with whom is not an attache from amongst the jinn (devil). They (the Companions) said: Allah's Messenger, with you too? Thereupon he said: Yes, but Allah helps me against him and so I am safe from his hand and **he does not command me but for good.**

Even if Satan only commands Muhammad for good, it still means Muhammad is commanded by Satan.







# Muhammad's miracles {#muhammads-miracles}

## Muhammad did NOT perform miracles {#no-miracles}

Surah 6:109

> And they swore by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would believe in it. Say, “Signs are only with Allah,” but how do you know that even if it did come, they would still not believe?

Surah 17:59

> And nothing prevented Us from sending miraculous signs except that the ancients disbelieved in them. ….


People didn't believe Muhammad was a prophet because true prophets of God were accompanied by signs and miracles. They asked for a sign, any signs, and swore that if they got it they would believe, but Allah/Muhammad gives the excuse that they would not believe anyway.

Also:

- Surah 6:37
- Surah 13:7
- Surah 20:20

## Muhammad DID perform miracles {#did-miracles}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3637](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3637)

> …The Meccan people requested Allah's Messenger to show them a miracle, and so he showed them the splitting of the moon.

So which is it? Muhammad never did any miracles, or Muhammad did miracles? This is a [contradiction](#contradictions).









# Muhammad and sex

## Mohammed was a pedophile {#child-sexual-abuse}

[Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls."

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. She was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but we're allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl" so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

[Sahih al Bukhari 299](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:299)

## Muhammad used to suck on Aishas tongue

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2386](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2386)

> Narrated Aisha, [Mother of the believers]: The Prophet used to kiss her and suck her tongue when he was fasting.

Consenting adults sucking each others tongues is none of my business, but why the obsession about telling such embarrasing details to the world? And since Aisha was technically a child during their entire marriage, this is disgusting.  

## Muhammad French-kissed a little boy

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183](https://sunnah.com/adab:1183)

> …Then he said, 'Where is the little one? Call the little one to me.' Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth. Then he said, O Allah, I love him, so love him and the one who loves him!'"

## Muhammad was baffled that other men were not pedophiles like him

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

The fact that other men are not drawn to sexually abuse children makes Muhammad flabbergasted.


## Muhammad believed a woman's silence means consent {#silence-is-consent}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5137](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5137)

> Narrated Aisha: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! A virgin feels shy." He said, "Her consent is (expressed by) her silence."

A true rape culture.

## Muhammad was "ridden" by tall black men all night long {#ridden}

[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 3778](https://www-islamweb-net.translate.goog/ar/library/content/6/3599/%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%87?_x_tr_sl=ar&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp), [3688](https://hadithportal-com.translate.goog/index.php?show=hadith&h_id=3688&book=35&_x_tr_sl=ar&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp) (Google translate), [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2861](https://sunnah.com/urn/730940)

These 3 hadiths mentions a weird story of a night excursion Muhammad took with a certain Abdullah ibn Masoud. They provide different complementary details, so I piece together the gist of the story with quotations from all 3.

So Muhammad and Abdullah go to the valley of Makkah. Muhammad draws a circle in the sand and tells Abdullah to stay inside of it, otherwise he will perish. Apparently Muhammad is expecting visitors. Abdullah obliges, but Muhammad goes outside the circle.

Along comes some men about whom Abdullah says:

> some men came to me that appeared as if they were from Az-Zut (A dark people, either from North Africa or India.), both their hair and their bodies. 

Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal 3778 provides this information:

> they have no clothes on them
> They were long

So some long, naked, seemingly North African men comes along. Then what happened?

> He said, “So they came and **started riding the Messenger of God**.” He said, “And the Prophet of God, recited to them.”

So a bunch of naked North African men meet up with Muhammad and "started riding" him? Meanwhile Muhammad is reciting Quran verses to them?

> When the pillar of dawn split, they started to go

When dawn breaks they stop "riding" Muhammad and leaves. 

> Then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, came **with heavy pain...from what they had ridden on.**

Muhammad stumbles back to Abdullah with heavy pain from being ridden all night by long, naked North African men?

> He said, “I find myself heavy,” … Then the Messenger of God, placed his head in my lap… 

Poor Muhammed has been ridden so hard by the long, naked North African men that he was in pain and exhausted, falling asleep in the lap of Abdullah.

> And the Messenger of Allah would snore when he slept. So while I was sitting there, and the Messenger of Allah was sleeping (with his head resting) on my thigh, there appeared some men wearing white garments, and Allah knows best just how handsome they were.

Then some other men shows up. They wear white and are apparently very handsome.

> Then they said to each other: 'We have not ever seen a slave (of Allah) who was given the likes of what this Prophet has been given.

I say... Muhammad "was given" good that night...

The white clad men starts pronouncing a parable over Muhammad while he is sleeping. Then they leave. Muhammad wakes up, declares that they were angels, and explains their parable.

But who were the long, naked, North African men who rode Muhammad all night long so that he became sore and exhausted? 

## Muhammad was kissing and cuddling with men

[Sunan Abu Dawud 3476](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3476)

> My father asked the Prophet for permission to kiss his body. When he was given permission, lifting his shirt he approached his body, and began to kiss and **stick to him**. 

Sunnah.com tries to fudge the wording but the Arabic says:

> قَالَتِ اسْتَأْذَنَ أَبِي النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَدَخَلَ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ قَمِيصِهِ فَجَعَلَ يُقَبِّلُ وَيَلْتَزِمُ

Which translates as:

> She said: My father asked permission from the Prophet, … and he came between him and his shirt and began to kiss and cuddle.

Another example is found in [Sunan Abi Dawud 5224](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5224)

> a man of the Ansar, said that while he was given to jesting and was talking to the people and making them laugh, the Prophet poked him under the ribs with a stick. He said: Let me take retaliation. He said: Take retaliation. He said: You are wearing a shirt but I am not. The Prophet then raised his shirt and the man embraced him and began to kiss his side. Then he said: This is what I wanted, Messenger of Allah!


## Muhammad ordered his followers to bite their father's penis

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 963 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/adab:963)

>  I heard the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, "Whomever attributes himself (in lineage) with an attribution of Jahiliyyah, then tell him to bite his father's male organ and do not speak figuratively (i.e. be explicit)." ' "

## Muhammad owned slaves {#slave-owner}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2468](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2468)

> So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: "Will you get the permission of (Allah's Apostle) for Umar (to enter)?

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5433](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5433)

> Allah's Messenger went to his slave tailor...

[Muwatta Malik book 21 hadith 25](https://sunnah.com/urn/509860)

> Rifaa ibn Zayd presented a black slave boy to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whose name was Midam...Midam was unsaddling the camel of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a stray arrow struck and killed him. The people said, 'Good luck to him! The Garden!' The Messenger of Allah said, 'No! By He in whose hand my self is! The cloak which he took from the spoils on the Day of Khaybar before they were distributed will blaze with fire on him.'

Muhammad had a black slave who was killed in battle, and Muhammad said he went to hell.

## Muhammad had a sex slave {#muhammads-sex-slave}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3959)

> It was narrated from Anas, that the Messenger of Allah had a female slave with whom he had intercourse, but 'Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: "O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.' until the end of the Verse.

The verse revealed was Surah 66:1-6. [Tafsir al-Jalalayn](http://web.archive.org/web/20220221075859/https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=1&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=66&tAyahNo=1&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2) says about Surah 66:1-6:

> O Prophet! Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa who had been away but who upon returning and finding out became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying ‘She is unlawful for me!’ seeking by making her unlawful for you to please your wives? And God is Forgiving Merciful having forgiven you this prohibition.

Muhammad was having sex with his sex slave Maria the Copt in the house of his wife Hansa, and quite understandably his wives complained. But then Allah [conveniently revealed](#convenient-revelation) Surah 66:1-6, that Muhammad can do that if he wishes, and if his wives complain, he should divorce them and they can literally go to hell. What a guy!



See [Muhammad and sex](#muhammad-and-sex), [Rape](#rape), [Sex slaves](#sex-slaves).

## Muhammad sold slaves {#slave-trader}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2534](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2534)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: A man amongst us declared that his slave would be freed after his death. The Prophet called for that slave and sold him. The slave died the same year.

## Muhammad traded black slaves {#black-slaves}

[Sahih Muslim 1602](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1602)

> Jabir … reported: There came a slave and pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle on migration; [who] did not know that he was a slave. Then there came his master and demanded him back, whereupon Allah's Apostle said: Sell him to me. And he bought him for two black slaves…

It seems the exchange rate is two black slaves for one Muslim slave.

This is from chapter 23 which heading  reads:

> Chapter 23: The permissibility of **selling animals for animals of the same kind and of different quality**

See also [Jihad](#jihad), and [Violence](#violence)


## Muhammad physically abused Aisha {#abusing-aisha}

[Sahih Muslim 974b](https://sunnah.com/muslim/11/132)

Long story short: Muhammad was sneaking around outside in the middle of the night, and Aisha thinking he was having an affair stalks him. But he discovers it and then Sunnah.com says:

> He gave me a nudge on the chest which I felt

However the Arabic says:

>‎  فَلَهَدَنِي فِي صَدْرِي لَهْدَةً أَوْجَعَتْنِي 

[Which actually means:](https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&tl=en&text=فَلَهَدَن%D9%90ي%20ف%D9%90ي%20صَدْر%D9%90ي%20لَهْدَةً%20أَوْجَعَتْن%D9%90ي%20&op=translate)

> He gave me a slap in the chest that hurt me

So Muhammad gets pissy and slaps his child wife in the chest so hard that it hurt her. This is in harmony with Surah 4:34 which allows men to beat their wives for any reason. So I don't understand why the people at Sunnah.com feels so ashamed over this that they feel they must rewrite it to deceive people about their religion. Maybe because sane people would reject their abusive cult if they knew. Without lies Islam dies.


## Muhammad had people assassinated 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3023](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3023)

> Allah's Messenger sent a group of the Ansar to Abu Rafi`. `Abdullah bin Atik entered his house at night and killed him while he was sleeping.

## Muhammad mutilated a woman {#muhammad-mutilated-woman}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6800](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6800)

> Narrated Aisha: The Prophet cut off the hand of a lady, and that lady used to come to me, and I used to convey her message to the Prophet and she repented, and her repentance was sincere.

## Muhammad personally stoned a woman {#muhammad-stoned-woman}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2555](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2555)

> a woman came to the Prophet and confessed to committing fornication. He issued orders, and her garments were tightened around her (so that her private parts would not become uncovered) then he stoned her, then he offered the funeral prayer for her.

In contrast Jesus defended a woman against being stoned for adultery. (John 8:1-11)

## Muhammad tortured people to death {#muhammad-tortured}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3539](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3539)

> … So he sent people in pursuit of them, and when they were brought he had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out and left them to die without cauterising them to stop the flow of blood. A version says nails were driven into their eyes. Another says he ordered nails to be heated and after having them blinded with them he had them thrown out on the harra, and although they begged for water they were left to die without being given any.

These people had stolen some camels so Muhammad **had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes put out** with white hot nails, and then left them to die from thirst and bleeding out.



## Muhammad killed children who had pubic hairs {#muhammad-killed-children}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 4981](https://sunnah.com/nasai:4981)

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2541](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2541)

> the Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as slaves













# Other things about Muhammad 



## Muhammad is equal to Allah in authority

Surah 33:36

> When God and His Messenger have decided on a matter that concerns them, it is not fitting for any believing man or woman to claim freedom of choice in that matter: whoever disobeys God and His Messenger is far astray.

Notice that Allah and Muhammad decide on things **together**, and the are equal in authority.

## Muhammad is inferior to Moses

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2411](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2411)

> The Prophet said, "Do not give me superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the first to gain consciousness, and will see Moses standing and holding the side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know whether (Moses) has also fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted him from that stroke."

## Muhammad died a pauper

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3596](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3596)

> "I heard 'Amr bin Al-Harith say: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah and he left nothing behind except his white mule, his weapon and some land which he left as a charity.'"

## Muhammad was worshipped by his contemporaries {#muhammad-worship}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1627](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1627)

At the funeral of Muhammad:

> Then Abu Bakr stood up, ascended the pulpit and said: ‘Whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Whoever **used to worship Muhammad**, Muhammad is dead.

Abu Bakr was telling the Muslims who **used to worship Muhammad** to not do so anymore.


## Muhammad was the first Muslim {#first-muslim}

Surah 6:14

> Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “**I have been commanded to be the first to submit** and not be one of the polytheists.”

## Allah considered Muhammad the perfect example {#perfect-example}

Surah 33:21

> Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.

[Quran 68:4](https://quran.com/68/4)

> And you are truly a man of outstanding character.
















# The death of Muhammad {#death-of-muhammad}

## How did Muhammad die?

## Allah promises to cut off his aorta if he tells a lie {#cutting-aorta}

[Quran 69:44-47](https://quran.com/69/44-47)

> Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺!

[Musnad Ahmad 107](https://sunnah.com/ahmad:107)

> And if he (Muhammad ﷺ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah). We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then **We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta)**, And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him...”

So Allah promises that Muhammed ever acts as a false prophet, Allah will cut off his aorta.

## Muhammad eats a poisoned lamb {#poisoned-lamb}

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4512](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512)

> Narrated Abu Hurairah: ...So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah  ate of it and the people also ate. He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done? She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah  then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when **it has cut off my aorta.**

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 4510](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4510)

After Muhammad kills the whole male Jewish population of Khaibar, a Jewish woman offers him roasted lamb. Being arguably the dumbest person in history, Muhammad accepts it. And it turns out that it was poisoned. Some of his men died, but Muhammad was affected for a long time from the lingering poison. Notice that Muhammad is saying that the pain from the poison feels like it is cutting off his aorta.

## Muhammad dies from having his aorta cut {#muhammad-dies}

[Sahih al Bukhari 4428](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4428)
  
> Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet  in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O `Aisha! I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, **I feel as if my aorta is being cut** from that poison."

[Sunnah Abu Dawud 4513](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4513)

> ...I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet  said: And I do not think about my illness except that. **This is the time when it cut off my aorta**...

Muhammad eventually died from the poisoned lamb of a jewish woman, and he did so while complaining that he felt as if his aorta was being cut. This is exactly how Allah said he would die if he was a false prophet.

Notice also the poetic biblical references in that a false anti-christ prophet was killed by Allah after eating of the Lamb that came from a Jewish woman.

## What was the last orders of Muhammad to his followers? {#last-orders}

[Sahih al Bukhari 3053](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3053)

> Ibn 'Abbas said... The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)"...

What was that, Ibn Abbas? The last order of Muhammad wasn't noteworthy enough to even commit to memory? But hey, at least you remembered the part about genocide, huh?

## What was the last words of Muhammad? {#last-words}

While Jesus used his last moments to forgive his enemies, Muhammad used his last moments to curse one third of the world population.

[Sahih Muslim 531](https://sunnah.com/muslim:531)

>  'A'isha and Abdullah reported: As the Messenger of Allah  was about to breathe his last, he drew his sheet upon his face and when he felt uneasy, he uncovered his face and said in that very state: Let there be curse upon the Jews and the Christians that they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship. He in fact warned (his men) against what they (the Jews and the Christians) did.

[Mishkat al-Masabih 712](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:712)

'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah's Messenger  looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Allah's Messenger  who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."
