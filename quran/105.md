The name comes from the famous historical episode referenced in the surah: the failed expedition of Abraha, a Christian ruler from Yemen, who is said to have marched on Mecca with war elephants to destroy the Kaʿba. The surah interprets the event as a direct act of divine intervention.

> <span id="v1">1</span> Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant ?

The surah opens with a rhetorical appeal to collective memory. The event is treated as well known and theologically significant. From a Christian perspective, this resembles biblical appeals to Israel’s historical acts of deliverance (e.g., Exodus 14). However, the verse assumes the audience’s acceptance of the event as a sign of divine favor toward Mecca, something Christianity would approach cautiously without independent corroboration.


> <span id="v2">2</span> Did He not bring their stratagem to nothing,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And send against them swarms of flying creatures,

> <span id="v4">4</span> Which pelted them with stones of baked clay,

> <span id="v5">5</span> And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle) ?
