# Adam

## Adam was 60 cubits tall

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://web.archive.org/web/20240310050216/https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

1 Arabic cubit was traditionally 64 cm long, which means Adam would be 38.4 meters tall.

## Adam was created in Allahs image 

[Sahih Muslim 2612 e](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2612e)

> When any one of you fights with his brother, he should avoid his face for Allah created Adam in His own image.

Islam apparently teaches the *Imago Dei* doctrine, that humans are made in the image of God. This means that humans are intrinsically valuable and unique and that hurting them is immoral because they are a physical representation of God.

Muslims however understand it not as that you shouldn't fight or hurt others, but that when you **do** fight, you just shouldn't hit them in the face.



# Angels

## Angels are afraid of dogs and pictures

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4002](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4002)

> Allah's Messenger said. "Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture"



# Death

## Grieving tortures the deceased 


[Sahih al-Bukhari 1286, 1287, 1288](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1286)

> Allah's Messenger has said, 'The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives?"

[Riyad as-Salihin 1657](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1657)

> The Prophet said, "The deceased is tortured in his grave for bewailing over him."





# Hell

## Murder victims go to hell

[Sahih al-Bukhari 31](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:31)

> When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.

## All people go to hell

[Surah 19:71](https://quran.com/19/71)

> There is not one of you but shall pass by Hell. This is a decree which your Lord will fulfil.

So apparently all people, including all Muslims, will go to hell. It's up to the iffy and contradictory means of [salvation](#salvation) that anyone would get out of there.


## Hell can think and speak

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2572](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2572)

> Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever asks Allah Paradise three times, Paradise says: 'O Allah, admit him into Paradise', and whoever seeks refuge from the Fire three times, the Fire says: 'O Allah, save him from the Fire.'"


# Jinn

## Jinn can be Muslims 

[Sunan Abi Dawud 5257](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:5257)

> In Medina a group of Jinn have embraced Islam

[Surah 46:29-31](https://quran.com/46/29-31)

> ˹Remember, O  Prophet,˺ when We sent a group of jinn your way to listen to the Quran. Then, upon hearing it, they said ˹to one another˺, “Listen quietly!” Then when it was over, they returned to their fellow jinn as warners. They declared, “O our fellow jinn! We have truly heard a scripture revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and the Straight Way. O  our fellow jinn! Respond to the caller of Allah and believe in him, He will forgive your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.


If demons wants you to follow Islam, that should be enough for you to understand that it's false.





# The Kaaba and Qiblah {#kaaba}

The Kaaba is a black cubic temple in Mecca towards which Muslims turn to pray. It used to be a pagan temple with 360 idols in it, until Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630AD and emptied it. In one of the corners of the building sits a big black stone (or actually the fragments of a stone glued together) which Muslims reverently touch and kiss thinking that it erases their sins. This is of course blatant idolatry.

### The Muslims used to pray toward Jerusalem {#jerusalem-qiblah}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 488](https://sunnah.com/nasai:488)

> "We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) with the Messenger of Allah for sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the Qiblah."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4486](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4486)

> The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but **he wished** that his Qibla would be the Kaaba (at Mecca). So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Kaaba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him.

The direction changed only because **he wished that his Qibla would be toward the Kaaba** and Allah, being [the servant of Muhammad](#allah-serves-muhammad), obliged and changed it.

At first Muhammad told them to pray toward Jerusalem because he wanted to have credibility as an Abrahamic religion alongside Christianity and Judaism. But in 624 A.D. after being rejected by the Jews and Christians in Medina, instead changed the prayer direction toward the pagan temple in Mecca to compromise with the pagan worshipers of Arabia.

Notice that since the prayer direction changed in 624, but he didn't clear out the idols in the Kaaba until 630 A.D., it means that all Muslims were praying towards a pagan temple filled with 360 pagan idols for 6 years!

### Peeing towards the Qiblah 

[Muhammad peed facing the Qiblah]{#peeing-qiblah}

### Pooping toward the Qiblah

[Muhammad pooped facing the Qiblah]{#pooping-qiblah}


## The Black stone {#black-stone}

### The black stone absorbs sins

[Mishkat al-Masabih 2577](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:2577)

> “The black stone descended from paradise whiter than milk, but the sins of the descendants of Adam made it black." 

See also: [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 877](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:877)

### Muhammad touched the black stone

[Sunan Ibn Majah 2946](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2946)

> “The Messenger of Allah did not touch the corners of the Ka’bah apart from the Black Corner (i.e., the corner where the Black Stone is) and the one that is next to it facing the houses of Banu Jumah (i.e., the Yemenite Corner).”

### Kissing the stone is idolatry

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1597](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1597)

> Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said "No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger kissing you I would not have kissed you."

Even Umar recognized that kissing the black stone was a pointless act of idolatry, but he only did so because Muhammad did so.

## foo 

# bar Paradise

The Islamic paradise is a very physical place where people will have sex, and eat food. But the food all tastes the same, and they will not poop, but belch out the excrement as musk.

## Paradise is a brothel

### Muslim men are rewarded with Houris {#houris}

“Indeed, We have produced the women of Paradise in a [new] creation. And made them virgins, devoted [to their husbands] and of equal age.” (Quran 56:35-37)

“Fair ones reserved in pavilions. Untouched before by any man or jinn.” (Quran 55:72-74)


### Houris have large, round, firm, swelling breasts {#breasts}

“Indeed, for the pious there is a triumph… full-breasted companions of equal age.” (Quran 78:31-33)

The Arabic term kawa‘ib in 78:33 literally means “firm, swelling breasts.”

### Houris have big eyes

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their wives will be large-eyed maidens...


Big, lustrous eyes:“They will have maidens with intensely white skin and large black eyes, as if they were hidden pearls.” (Quran 52:20)

### Houris are hairless 

Glowing, hairless, smooth skin:“If one of the women of paradise were to appear to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between heaven and earth with light and fragrance.” (Tirmidhi, 2538)

“They will be hairless except for their eyebrows and eyelashes.” (Tirmidhi, 2536)

### Houris don’t need to poop, pee, or sweat, they exist for one purpose: eternal male pleasure.

“They will neither urinate, defecate, nor suffer from phlegm or mucus. Their sweat will be musk.” (Muslim, 2834)

### Endless sex 

The Prophet was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, do we have sexual intercourse in Paradise?” He replied: “Yes, by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, a man will have sexual intercourse with a hundred virgins in one morning.” (Ibn Majah, 4337)

Men will be given the strength of 100 men in sexual performance. (Tirmidhi, 2536)

“The believer will be given such and such strength in paradise for intercourse… A single intercourse with one of the virgins of paradise will last seventy thousand years.” (Al-Suyuti, Al-Haba’ik fi Akhbar al-Mala’ik)

### 72 virgins

“A martyr will have 72 virgins.” (Tirmidhi, 1663)

“The lowest rank of a person in paradise will have 80,000 servants and 72 wives.” (Ibn Majah, 4337)

[Mishkat al-Masabih 5648](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:

> Abu Sa'id reported God's messenger as saying, "The lowliest of the inhabitants of paradise will be he who has eighty thousand servants, seventy-two wives,...


## All fruit looks the same in paradise {#boring-fruit}

[Quran 2:25](https://quran.com/2/25)

> And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens under which rivers flow. Every time they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” for they will be given fruit that resemble one another. They will have purified spouses, and they will abide therein forever.

## Paradise dwellers don't poop but belch and sweat musk {#belching-musk}

> I heard Allah's Apostle as saying that the inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrah. It was said: Then, what would happen with food? Thereupon he said: They would belch and sweat (and it would be over with their food), and their sweat would be that of musk and they would glorify and praise Allah as easily as you breathe.

- [Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)



## Paradise dwellers will be about 30 years old 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2545](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2545)

> The people of Paradise shall enter Paradise without body hair, Murd, with Kuhl on their eyes, thirty years of age or thirty-three years.

See also:

- [Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2539](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2539)

## Paradise dwellers will be 38 meters tall {#tall-people}

[Sahih Muslim 2834 c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2834c)

> ...their form would be alike as one single person after the form of their father (Adam) sixty cubits tall.

60 Arabic cubits á 64cm each equals 38.4 meters.

## Huge tree

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3252](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3252)

> The Prophet said "There is a tree in Paradise (which is so big and huge that) a rider could travel in its shade for a hundred years.

## There are 7 heavens {#seven-heavens}

[Surah 2:29](https://quran.com/2/29)

> It is He Who created for you all that is in the earth, then He turned towards the heaven and made them seven heavens...

## Paradise can think and speak

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2572](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2572)

> Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever asks Allah Paradise three times, Paradise says: 'O Allah, admit him into Paradise', and whoever seeks refuge from the Fire three times, the Fire says: 'O Allah, save him from the Fire.'"

## Paradise for women

[Sahih al-Bukhari 4879, 4880](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:4879)

> Allah's Messenger said, "In Paradise there is a pavilion made of a single hollow pearl sixty miles wide, in each corner of which there are wives who will not see those in the other corners; and the believers will visit and enjoy them.

I don't know how a pearl could have corners, but apparently at the corners of this sixty mile wide pearl, Muslim wives are standing, waiting like prostitutes to be sexually used by Muslim men. The islamic afterlife is all about perverted sex.

# Prayer

## Looking up while praying makes you go blind {#praying-blind}

[Sahih al Bukhari 750](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:750)

> The Prophet said, "What is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer?" His talk grew stern while delivering this speech and he said, "They should stop (looking towards the sky during the prayer); otherwise their eyesight would be taken away."

However Muhammed looked up to heaven while praying.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 1010](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1010)

> When the Messenger of Allah prayed towards Baitul-Maqdis, he would often lift his face towards the heavens.

## Raising your head before the Imam while praying turns it into a donkey head {#donkey-head}

[Sahih al Bukhari 691](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:691)

> The Prophet said, "Isn't he who raises his head before the Imam afraid that Allah may transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure into that of a donkey?"

## Prayer is nullified by donkeys, black dogs and women {#nullified-prayer}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> If he does not have something as high as the back of a camel saddle in front of him, then his prayer is nullified by a woman, a donkey or a black dog."

[Sahih al-Bukhari 511](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:511)

> Narrated Aisha: The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, "Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)."

## Muslims pray to Muhammad 

This is not part of the Quran or Hadiths but it is worth mentioning since this is part of the Tashahhud, a section of the prayer that all faithful Muslims recite five times every day. In that prayer is a section that goes:

‎> ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.

> as-salāmu ʿalayka ʿayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhu, 

> "Peace be upon you, O Prophet, as well as God's mercy and His blessings. 

Notice that this is not talking *about* Muhammad, but *to* Muhammad. Muhammad is dead and gone, yet billions of times a day, people are addressing him as if he was alive and able to hear them. In other words this is a prayer directed toward Muhammad. Muslims are praying to Muhammad.







# Resurrection 

## The hour of resurrection 

[Surah 22:6-7](https://quran.com/22/6-7)

> That is because Allâh: He is the Truth, and it is He Who gives life to the dead, and it is He Who is Able to do all things. And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it; and certainly, Allâh will resurrect those who are in the graves.

The one who is called the truth, and who will raise people to life at the hour of resurrection is God. Let's see what the Bible says.

John 5:25,28,29 

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live....28 Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice 29 and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

John 14:6 

> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

The one who is called the truth, and who will raise people to life at the hour of resurrection is Jesus. So the Quran admits that Jesus is God.



# Salvation 

How Muslims are saved on judgment day is confusing and contradictory.


## Muslims are saved by works

[Surah 13:29](https://quran.com/13/29)[; 18:107](https://quran.com/18/107)[; 22:50](https://quran.com/22/50)[; 30:15](https://quran.com/30/15) 32:19[; 98:7](https://quran.com/98/7)

> And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and noble provision.

Islam is a works-righteousness religion. And as such it can't save, because none of our deeds are good enough to bribe God.


## Jews and Christians are also saved

[Surah 2:62](https://quran.com/2/62)

> The [Muslim] believers, the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabians- all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good- will have their rewards with their Lord. 

## No ransom will be accepted for another person {#no-ransom}

[Surah 2:48](https://quran.com/2/48)

> Guard yourselves against a Day when no soul will stand in place of another, no intercession will be accepted for it, nor any ransom; nor will they be helped.

So there will be no ransom for anyone. This contradicts [other sources saying that Muslims can be ransomed](#ransomed-from-hell). 


## Ransomed from hell by Jews and Christians {#ransomed-from-hell}

[Sahih Muslim 2767 a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2767a)

> Abu Musa' reported that Allah's Messenger said:
> When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your rescue from Hell-Fire.

Christianity teaches that Jesus is the perfect one who does not deserve hellfire but took this punishment in stead of those who have faith in him. Some Muslims think this is unjust saying that it's wrong that someone should take the punishment for someone else's sin. However here, Allah will let Jews and Christians take the punishment for the sins of Muslims. Is that just, though?

Also this implies that Jews and Christians as not sinners deserving of hell, but that Muslims are sinners deserving of hell. Otherwise, if the Jews and Christians were already in hell, the exchange could not be made. And it means Allah is thoroughly unrighteous for throwing innocent people into hell so he can save guilty people.

- [Riyad as-Salihin 432](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:432)

## The Quran will come and intercede 


See [The Quran is alive and will intercede on judgment day](#quran-intercession). It will come as a flock of birds and convince Allah to have mercy on those who read it.

## Muhammad can save {#muhammad-saves}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6807](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6807)

> The Prophet said, "Whoever guarantees me what is between his legs and what is between his jaws, I guarantee him Paradise."


## Muhammad can NOT save {#muhammad-saves-not}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2753](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2753)

> Allah's Messenger got up and said, "O people of Quraish! Save yourselves from the Hellfire as I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Bani Abd Manaf! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment, O Safiya, the Aunt of Allah's Messenger! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muhammad! Ask me anything from my wealth, but I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment."


## The black stone will intercede 

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 961](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:961)

> The Messenger of Allah said about the Black Stone: "By Allah! Allah will raise it on the Day of Resurrection with two eyes by which it sees and a tongue that it speaks with, testifying to whoever touched it in truth."

So Allah does not know who have and have not touched it? 

The fact that "the black stone" is broken into 8 pieces held together by glue is also a big problem since there really is no black stone. Are the 8 pieces going to join together? Or are they going to each get a set of eyes and mouth?

## Muhammad will intercede for those dying in Medina

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3917](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:3917)

> the Prophet said: "Whoever is able to die in Al-Madinah, then let him die there, for I will intercede for those who die 

## Invading India or being Christian ensures salvation

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3175](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3175)

> The Messenger of Allah said: 'There are two groups of my Ummah whom Allah will free from the Fire: The group that invades India, and the group that will be with 'Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him.'"

## Memorising the 99 names of Allah ensures salvation 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7392](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7392)

> Allah's Messenger said, "Allah has ninety-nine Names, one-hundred less one; and he who memorized them all by heart will enter Paradise." 




## Being sick or injured cleanses from sins


[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 498](https://sunnah.com/adab:498)

> It is narrated by Ayeshah that the Prophet said, "when a Muslim is afflicted by an anxiety, pain or sickness then, because of that, his sins are atoned. So much, so that if a thorn pricks him or he suffers a simple, minor injury (His sins are forgiven)”.



## Having three dead children saves

[Sahih al-Bukhari 1381](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1381)

> Allah's Messenger said, "Any Muslim whose three children died before the age of puberty will be granted Paradise by Allah because of His mercy to them."


## Paradise and hell can intercede

[Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2572](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:2572)

> Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever asks Allah Paradise three times, Paradise says: 'O Allah, admit him into Paradise', and whoever seeks refuge from the Fire three times, the Fire says: 'O Allah, save him from the Fire.'"






# Sin

## Confessing sins is bad

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6069](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6069)

> Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger saying. "All the sins of my followers will be forgiven except those of the Mujahirin (those who commit a sin openly or disclose their sins to the people). An example of such disclosure is that a person commits a sin at night and though Allah screens it from the public, then he comes in the morning, and says, 'O so-and-so, I did such-and-such (evil) deed yesterday,' though he spent his night screened by his Lord (none knowing about his sin) and in the morning he removes Allah's screen from himself."

In Christianity, confessing your sins is important. 

> 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

But in Islam, confessing your sins is a sure way to make sure they are **not** forgiven by God. 

## Allah predetermines adultery

[Sahih Muslim 2657 b](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2657b)

> Verily Allah has fixed the very portion of adultery which a man will indulge in, and which he of necessity must commit.

A man who commits adultery is really only doing the will of Allah, and has no choice in it.

## Who forgives sins?

### Only Allah forgives sins

[Surah 3:135](https://quran.com/3/135)

> They are those who, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins—and who forgives sins except Allah?

### But Muhammad also forgives sins 

[Surah 46:31](https://quran.com/46/31)

> Our people, respond to the one who calls you to God. Believe in Him: He will forgive you your sins and protect you from a painful torment.’
