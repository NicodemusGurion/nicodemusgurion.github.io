> <span id="v1">1</span> Hast you observed him who belieth religion ?

> <span id="v2">2</span> That is he who repelleth the orphan,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And urgeth not the feeding of the needy.

> <span id="v4">4</span> Ah, woe unto worshippers

> <span id="v5">5</span> Who are heedless of their prayer;

> <span id="v6">6</span> Who would be seen (at worship)

> <span id="v7">7</span> Yet refuse small kindnesses!
