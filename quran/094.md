> <span id="v1">1</span> Have We not caused your bosom to dilate,

> <span id="v2">2</span> And eased you of the burden

> <span id="v3">3</span> Which weighed down your back;

> <span id="v4">4</span> And exalted your fame ?

> <span id="v5">5</span> But lo! with hardship goeth ease,

> <span id="v6">6</span> See! with hardship goeth ease;

> <span id="v7">7</span> So when you art relieved, still toil

> <span id="v8">8</span> And strive to please your Lord.
