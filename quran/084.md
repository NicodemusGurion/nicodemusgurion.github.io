> <span id="v1">1</span> When the heaven is split asunder

> <span id="v2">2</span> And attentive to her Lord in fear,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And when the earth is spread out

> <span id="v4">4</span> And hath cast out all that was in her, and is empty

> <span id="v5">5</span> And attentive to her Lord in fear!

> <span id="v6">6</span> Thou, verily, O man, art working toward your Lord a work which you will meet (in His presence).

> <span id="v7">7</span> Then whoso is given his account in his right hand

> <span id="v8">8</span> He truly will receive an easy reckoning

> <span id="v9">9</span> And will return unto his folk in joy.

> <span id="v10">10</span> But whoso is given his account behind his back,

> <span id="v11">11</span> He surely will invoke destruction

> <span id="v12">12</span> And be thrown to scorching fire.

> <span id="v13">13</span> He verily lived joyous with his folk,

> <span id="v14">14</span> He verily deemed that he would never return (unto Allah).

> <span id="v15">15</span> Nay, but lo! his Lord is ever looking on him!

> <span id="v16">16</span> Oh, I swear by the afterglow of sunset,

> <span id="v17">17</span> And by the night and all that it enshroudeth,

> <span id="v18">18</span> And by the moon when she is at the full,

> <span id="v19">19</span> That you shall journey on from plane to plane.

> <span id="v20">20</span> What aileth them, then, that they believe not

> <span id="v21">21</span> And, when the Qur'an is recited unto them, worship not (Allah) ?

> <span id="v22">22</span> Nay, but those who disbelieve will deny;

> <span id="v23">23</span> And Allah knoweth best what they are hiding.

> <span id="v24">24</span> So give them tidings of a painful doom,

> <span id="v25">25</span> Save those who believe and do good works, for theirs is a reward unfailing.
