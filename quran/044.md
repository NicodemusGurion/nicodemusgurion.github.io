| <span id="v1">1</span> | Ha. Mim. | |
| <span id="v2">2</span> | By the Scripture that maketh plain | |
| <span id="v3">3</span> | Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - | |
| <span id="v4">4</span> | Whereon every wise command is made clear | |
| <span id="v5">5</span> | As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - | |
| <span id="v6">6</span> | A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, | |
| <span id="v7">7</span> | Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would be sure. | |
| <span id="v8">8</span> | There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and Lord of your forefathers. | |
| <span id="v9">9</span> | Nay, but they play in doubt. | |
| <span id="v10">10</span> | But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce visible smoke | |
| <span id="v11">11</span> | That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. | |
| <span id="v12">12</span> | (Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are believers. | |
| <span id="v13">13</span> | How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain (the Truth) had already come unto them, | |
| <span id="v14">14</span> | And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a madman ? | |
| <span id="v15">15</span> | Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). | |
| <span id="v16">16</span> | On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth We shall punish. | |
| <span id="v17">17</span> | And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them a noble messenger, | |
| <span id="v18">18</span> | Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you. | |
| <span id="v19">19</span> | And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. | |
| <span id="v20">20</span> | And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to death. | |
| <span id="v21">21</span> | And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. | |
| <span id="v22">22</span> | And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. | |
| <span id="v23">23</span> | Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be followed, | |
| <span id="v24">24</span> | And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. | |
| <span id="v25">25</span> | How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, | |
| <span id="v26">26</span> | And the cornlands and the goodly sites | |
| <span id="v27">27</span> | And pleasant things wherein they took delight! | |
| <span id="v28">28</span> | Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; | |
| <span id="v29">29</span> | And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. | |
| <span id="v30">30</span> | And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; | |
| <span id="v31">31</span> | (We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. | |
| <span id="v32">32</span> | And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. | |
| <span id="v33">33</span> | And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. | |
| <span id="v34">34</span> | Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: | |
| <span id="v35">35</span> | There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. | |
| <span id="v36">36</span> | Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! | |
| <span id="v37">37</span> | Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty. | |
| <span id="v38">38</span> | And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in play. | |
| <span id="v39">39</span> | We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. | |
| <span id="v40">40</span> | Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, | |
| <span id="v41">41</span> | A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, | |
| <span id="v42">42</span> | Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. | |
| <span id="v43">43</span> | Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, | |
| <span id="v44">44</span> | The food of the sinner! | |
| <span id="v45">45</span> | Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies | |
| <span id="v46">46</span> | As the seething of boiling water. | |
| <span id="v47">47</span> | (And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, | |
| <span id="v48">48</span> | Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. | |
| <span id="v49">49</span> | (Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! | |
| <span id="v50">50</span> | Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. | |
| <span id="v51">51</span> | Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. | |
| <span id="v52">52</span> | Amid gardens and watersprings, | |
| <span id="v53">53</span> | Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. | |
| <span id="v54">54</span> | Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely eyes. | |
| <span id="v55">55</span> | They call therein for every fruit in safety. | |
| <span id="v56">56</span> | They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them from the doom of hell, | |
| <span id="v57">57</span> | A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. | |
| <span id="v58">58</span> | And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may heed. | |
| <span id="v59">59</span> | Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting. | |
