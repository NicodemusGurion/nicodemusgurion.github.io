> <span id="v1">1</span> See! We have given you Abundance;

Historically, this verse is understood as reassurance during a period when Muhammad was mocked for lacking male heirs and influence. The surah counters shame with divine affirmation: God has already granted abundance.

Scripture also records God comforting His servants amid rejection (e.g., Psalm 2; Matthew 3:17). However, Christianity grounds divine favor not in future success or legacy, but ultimately in obedience and suffering (Isaiah 53; Philippians 2:8–9).

((108:1, Abundance, Blessing))

> <span id="v2">2</span> So pray to your Lord, and sacrifice.

The response to blessing is prescribed ritual action - prayer and sacrifice. Christianity agrees that gratitude should lead to worship (Romans 12:1), but differs sharply in sacrificial theology. In the New Testament, sacrifice is no longer repeated ritual but fulfilled once for all in Christ (Hebrews 10:10). Thus, Surah 108 reflects a continuing sacrificial economy, whereas Christianity proclaims its completion. Allah is a venting machine - input sacrifices and prayer in the slot, and blessings fall out the hatch.

((108:2, Sacrifice, Pray))

> <span id="v3">3</span> See! it is your insulter (and not you) who is without posterity.

The final verse promises reversal: those who insult the prophet will lose lasting legacy. From a Christian lens, this introduces a retributive tone that contrasts with Jesus’ call to love enemies and accept reproach (Matthew 5:44; 1 Peter 2:23). Christianity acknowledges divine justice, but postpones final vindication to God’s judgment rather than tying it to prophetic honor or historical outcome.

((108:3, Vindictive, Insults))
