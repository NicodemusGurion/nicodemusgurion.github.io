Claim: There are thousands of Bible contradictions; therefore it cannot be God’s Word.

Why it’s misleading:

Lists circulated online often rely on:
- Ignoring genre (e.g., parable vs. narrative)
- Misunderstanding ancient historiography
- Translation issues
- Citation-style differences (ancient authors did not use modern quotation conventions)

Most alleged contradictions dissolve under careful exegesis.

#Islam needs the Bible, the Bible does not need Islam

The Quran affirms the inspiration, preservation, and authority of the Bible in Surah 2:4,41,89,91,97,101,111;3:3-4,23,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,48,66,68;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,48,105;26:196;28:48-49;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19

Islam is supposed to be a final revelation that builds on the Jewish and Christian revelations. It can not stand on its own merit. It borrows its stories and perceived authority from the Bible. It claims to worship the same God. So any argument against the Bible is just Muslims trying to defend Islam by betraying Islam.


# The islamic dilemma

## The Quran affirms the Bible

The Quran affirms the inspiration, preservation, and authority of the Bible in Surah 2:4,41,89,91,97,101,111;3:3-4,23,81,93,184;4:47;5:44,48,66,68;6:91-92;10:37,94;12:111;16:43;20:133;21:7,48,105;26:196;28:48-49;35:25,31;37:37;40:53;46:12,30;87:18-19

The Qur’an repeatedly affirms the Bible as God’s Word. It calls Jews and Christians “People of the Book” and says God gave the Tawrah and Injil (Torah & Gospel). If these books were corrupted, the Qur’an is wrong for praising them.

The Qur’an says no one can change God’s words (Qur’an 6:115; 18:27). If the Bible is God’s word—as the Qur’an claims—then Muslims can’t say it was corrupted without contradicting their own scripture.

The Qur’an tells Muhammad to consult the Scriptures that came before him if he doubts (Qur’an 10:94). Why would God send him to “corrupted” books? This only makes sense if the Bible was reliable.

The Qur’an says Christians should judge by the Gospel (Qur’an 5:47). That command is meaningless if the Gospel was already lost or corrupted. The Qur’an treats it as present and authoritative.

## The Quran and Bible contradict one another

But the Qur’an contradicts the Bible on crucial doctrines:
Jesus was crucified vs. Qur’an 4:157 denying it
Jesus as Son of God vs. Qur’an 112:3
Salvation by Christ’s atonement vs. Qur’an 4:171
Two contradictory revelations cannot both be true.

The Bible contradicts the Qur’an’s theology: Jesus is eternally divine (John 1:1), died for sins (1 Cor 15:3), and rose bodily. Therefore, if the Bible is true, the Qur’an’s message must be false.

The Bible teaches that if any person or angel comes with a different message, that one is accursed. (Galatians 1:8) Muhammad came with a different message brought by an angel. Hence the Bible calls Muhammad accursed.

## The dilemma

If the Bible is correct about Jesus’ death, deity, and resurrection, then Islam is false because the Qur’an denies all three.
If the Bible is wrong, then the Qur’an is false for affirming and endorsing a “corrupted” book.

Islam depends on the Bible being true enough to validate Muhammad—and false enough to contradict Christian doctrine. But if it’s true, Islam collapses. If it’s false, the Qur’an collapses. There is no escape.


If the Bible is true then the Qur’an contradicts it which means the Qur’an is false.
If the Bible is false then the Qur’an affirms it as authoritative and commands obedience to a false book, which means the Qur’an is false.
Either way, Islam refutes itself.
