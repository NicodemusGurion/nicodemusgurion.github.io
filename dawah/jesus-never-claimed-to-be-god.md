Claim: Jesus never claimed to be God; Christians invented that doctrine.

Why it’s false:

High Christological statements in the New Testament—especially in John 1, John 8, John 20, Philippians 2, and the Synoptic “Son of Man” claims—are very strong divine claims in a first-century Jewish context.
Even secular scholars acknowledge that the earliest Christian communities worshiped Jesus.



# Jesus is Eternal and Yahweh

Jesus said, “Before Abraham was, I AM” (John 8:58). The Jews tried to stone Him for blasphemy because “I AM”, or Yahweh, is God’s personal name in Exodus 3:14. They understood exactly that He was claiming to be Yahweh God.

# Jesus is one with the Father 

When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one,” the Jews again tried to kill Him “because You, a mere man, claim to be God” (John 10:30–33). His enemies understood Him better than modern Dawah does.

# Jesus forgives sin

Jesus forgave sins (Mark 2). The scribes said, “Only God can forgive sins.” Exactly. Jesus didn’t deny it—He proved He had divine authority by healing the man. That’s a divine claim in action, not theory.

# Jesus accepts worship 

Thomas calls Jesus “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28). Jesus doesn’t correct him—He blesses him. If Jesus wasn’t God, this would be idolatry. Instead, Jesus accepts worship.

# The Son of Man

In Daniel 7, the “Son of Man” receives worship and eternal authority. Jesus uses that title for Himself over 80 times. Far from being “just human,” it’s one of the strongest divine claims in Jewish literature.


# Jews accepted him as God

If Jesus never claimed divinity, why did early Christians—strict monotheistic Jews—worship Him right away? Jews don’t worship humans. What Jesus said and did forced them to recognize Jesus as divine from the start.

# Islam teaches that Jesus is divine

Muslims say Jesus never claimed divinity, but the Qur’an says Jesus creates life from clay and knows the unseen—both divine attributes in Islam. Or does Islam teach that there is more than one all-knowing creator and life giver?


Jesus says all people will be judged by Him (John 5:22). Islam also agrees that humanity will be judged by Jesus. (Sahih al-Bukhari 3448) But only God judges humanity. A mere prophet doesn’t sit on God’s throne on Judgment Day. Jesus claims the divine prerogative.


# "Jesus never said 'I am God, worship me'

Saying “Jesus never said ‘I am God, worship me’” is silly. God doesn’t need to speak in 21st-century English. His words and deeds already communicated divinity in the language and culture of His audience—and they understood perfectly.
