| <span id="v1" data-verse="80:1" data-tags="">1</span> | He frowned and turned away | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="80:2" data-tags="">2</span> | Because the blind man came unto him. | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="80:3" data-tags="">3</span> | What could inform thee but that he might grow (in grace) | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="80:4" data-tags="">4</span> | Or take heed and so the reminder might avail him ? | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="80:5" data-tags="">5</span> | As for him who thinketh himself independent, | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="80:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Unto him thou payest regard. | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="80:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace). | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="80:8" data-tags="">8</span> | But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="80:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And hath fear, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="80:10" data-tags="">10</span> | From him thou art distracted. | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="80:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Nay, but verily it is an Admonishment, | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="80:12" data-tags="">12</span> | So let whosoever will pay heed to it, | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="80:13" data-tags="">13</span> | On honoured leaves | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="80:14" data-tags="">14</span> | Exalted, purified, | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="80:15" data-tags="">15</span> | (Set down) by scribes | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="80:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Noble and righteous. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="80:17" data-tags="">17</span> | Man is (self-)destroyed: how ungrateful! | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="80:18" data-tags="">18</span> | From what thing doth He create him ? | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="80:19" data-tags="">19</span> | From a drop of seed. He createth him and proportioneth him, | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="80:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Then maketh the way easy for him, | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="80:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Then causeth him to die, and burieth him; | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="80:22" data-tags="">22</span> | Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life. | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="80:23" data-tags="">23</span> | Nay, but (man) hath not done what He commanded him. | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="80:24" data-tags="">24</span> | Let man consider his food: | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="80:25" data-tags="">25</span> | How We pour water in showers | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="80:26" data-tags="">26</span> | Then split the earth in clefts | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="80:27" data-tags="">27</span> | And cause the grain to grow therein | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="80:28" data-tags="">28</span> | And grapes and green fodder | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="80:29" data-tags="">29</span> | And olive-trees and palm-trees | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="80:30" data-tags="">30</span> | And garden-closes of thick foliage | |
| <span id="v31" data-verse="80:31" data-tags="">31</span> | And fruits and grasses: | |
| <span id="v32" data-verse="80:32" data-tags="">32</span> | Provision for you and your cattle. | |
| <span id="v33" data-verse="80:33" data-tags="">33</span> | But when the Shout cometh | |
| <span id="v34" data-verse="80:34" data-tags="">34</span> | On the day when a man fleeth from his brother | |
| <span id="v35" data-verse="80:35" data-tags="">35</span> | And his mother and his father | |
| <span id="v36" data-verse="80:36" data-tags="">36</span> | And his wife and his children, | |
| <span id="v37" data-verse="80:37" data-tags="">37</span> | Every man that day will have concern enough to make him heedless (of others). | |
| <span id="v38" data-verse="80:38" data-tags="">38</span> | On that day faces will be bright as dawn, | |
| <span id="v39" data-verse="80:39" data-tags="">39</span> | Laughing, rejoicing at good news; | |
| <span id="v40" data-verse="80:40" data-tags="">40</span> | And other faces, on that day, with dust upon them, | |
| <span id="v41" data-verse="80:41" data-tags="">41</span> | Veiled in darkness, | |
| <span id="v42" data-verse="80:42" data-tags="">42</span> | Those are the disbelievers, the wicked. | |
