The two gospel writers Matthew and Luke agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Mark and John do not cover the birth of Jesus.

> Matthew 2:1 Now after **Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea** in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, 

> Luke 2:4-7 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called **Bethlehem**, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. 6 And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 7 And **she gave birth** to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

No disagreements or contradictions.
