Claim: The Council of Nicaea chose which books went into the Bible.

Why it’s false:

The canon was recognized through widespread usage in the early church, not dictated by Nicaea. Nicaea dealt with Christological issues, not the canon. Early lists (e.g., Muratorian Fragment) predate Nicaea by over a century.
