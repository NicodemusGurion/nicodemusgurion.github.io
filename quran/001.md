###### 1

Surah 1:1

> In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.

So as a first time reader I would be confused as to who this Allah person is. 

###### 2

Surah 1:2

> All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,

Apparently he is lord of all worlds, so it seems he is some intergalactic warlord.

###### 3

Surah 1:3

> the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, 

The author of this really lays it on thick with how awesome Allah is, without providing any evidence why I should accept his claims.

###### 4

Surah 1:4

> Master of the Day of Recompense. 

Verse 4 says Allah is the Lord of judgment day. This is a title describing Jesus. So [Jesus from the Bible](../jesus-is-allah) holds the same title as Allah from the Quran.

###### 5
###### 6

Surah 1:5,6

> You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help. 
> Guide us to the straight path:

In verse 6 the author asks Allah to guide him in the straight path. Perhaps this is why so many Muslims are converting to Christianity, or at least apostatising from Islam.

###### 7

Surah 1:7

> the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.

Allah is not a well rounded balanced person, but has a rather bipolar view of people, either blessing or being displeased with them.
