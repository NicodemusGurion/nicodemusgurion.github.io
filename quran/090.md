| <span id="v1" data-verse="90:1" data-tags="">1</span> | Nay, I swear by this city - | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="90:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And thou art an indweller of this city - | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="90:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And the begetter and that which he begat, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="90:4" data-tags="">4</span> | We verily have created man in an atmosphere: | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="90:5" data-tags="">5</span> | Thinketh he that none hath power over him ? | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="90:6" data-tags="">6</span> | And he saith: I have destroyed vast wealth: | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="90:7" data-tags="">7</span> | Thinketh he that none beholdeth him ? | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="90:8" data-tags="">8</span> | Did We not assign unto him two eyes | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="90:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And a tongue and two lips, | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="90:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And guide him to the parting of the mountain ways ? | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="90:11" data-tags="">11</span> | But he hath not attempted the Ascent - | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="90:12" data-tags="">12</span> | Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Ascent is! - | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="90:13" data-tags="">13</span> | (It is) to free a slave, | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="90:14" data-tags="">14</span> | And to feed in the day of hunger. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="90:15" data-tags="">15</span> | An orphan near of kin, | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="90:16" data-tags="">16</span> | Or some poor wretch in misery, | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="90:17" data-tags="">17</span> | And to be of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and exhort one another to pity. | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="90:18" data-tags="">18</span> | Their place will be on the right hand. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="90:19" data-tags="">19</span> | But those who disbelieve Our revelations, their place will be on the left hand. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="90:20" data-tags="">20</span> | Fire will be an awning over them. | |
