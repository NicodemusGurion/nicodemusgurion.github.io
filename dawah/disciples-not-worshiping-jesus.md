Claim: Jesus’ disciples never believed he was divine until centuries later.”

Why it’s false:

Christians were immediately known as "those who called on the name of Jesus", i.e. worshipped and prayed to Jesus. The earliest Christian worship practices (hymns, prayers, doxologies) include Christ as recipient of worship.
1 Corinthians 8:6 — written within ~20 years of the crucifixion — places Jesus inside the Jewish Shema (“Hear, O Israel”), the highest monotheistic confession.
