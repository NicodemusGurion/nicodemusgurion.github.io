# Divorce

Surah 2:230

> So if a husband divorces his wife, then it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is divorced. 

Before a man can remarry a wife he divorced, she must first be passed around like a joint for others to enjoy.

In Deuteronomy 24:1-4 gives the exact opposite command:

> “When a man takes a wife and marries her, … and he writes her a certificate of divorce … and if she goes and becomes another man’s wife, 3 and the latter man hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce … then her former husband, who sent her away, may **not** take her again to be his wife, after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination before the LORD. 


# Intoxicants 

See Surah 5:90,91; 16:65-69; 37:43-46; 47:15; 83:22-26

## Intoxicants (wine) is one of the blessings of Allah

Surah 16:65-69

> And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death. ... pure milk, pleasant to drink ... And **from the fruits of palm trees and grapevines you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome provision**. Surely in this is a sign for those who understand

These verses lists some blessings of Allah, which includes rains to revive the earth, milk from cows, honey from bees, and most interestingly, **intoxicants** i.e. alcohol, which is made from fruits and grapes.

So wine is a blessing of Allah.

## Wine is from Satan

Surah 5:90,91

> Wine, gambling, altars and divining arrows are filth, made up by Satan. ...Satan wishes only to plant enmity and malice between you through wine and gambling...

So wine is bad, mkay?


## Allah serves wine in Paradise

Surah 47:15

> Paradise which the God-fearing have been promised: in it shall be rivers of incorruptible water, rivers of milk unchanging in taste,and **rivers of wine, a delight to those that drink;**

So in Paradise there will be rivers of wine.

But wait, isn't wine an invention of Satan? 

But wait, isn't wine a blessing of Allah?

Are perhaps Satan and Allah the same person?

## If someone drinks wine they should be flogged to death

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4482](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4482)

> The Prophet said: If they (the people) drink wine, flog them, again if they drink it, flog them. Again if they drink it, kill them.

# Lying 

## Three situations in which you can lie

[Sunan Abi Dawud 4921 (Sahih)](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4921)


> I did not hear the Messenger of Allah making a concession for anything people say falsely except in three matters. The Messenger of Allah would say: I do not count as a liar a man who puts things right between people, saying a word by which he intends only putting things right, and a man who says something in war, and a man who says something to his wife, or a wife who says something to her husband.

In Islam you can lie:

1. To promote peace
2. In war
3. In marriage

These pretty much cover all of the human conditions: peaceful, non-peaceful and close relationships. Since Islam is at constant war with the non-Islamic world, a Muslim is always allowed to lie to a non-Muslim. Even Muslims are allowed to lie to one another to preserve peace, which is probably part of why Dawahists lie to Muslims about everything to keep them being Muslims. You can't even trust your spouse, your closest companion. Besides polygamy, child marriage, easy and prolific divorce, and mutah, this is yet another way Islam perverts and destroys the concept of marriage.

In other words, lying is basically permitted at any and all times for any and all reasons to any and all people, which means that you can never trust a Muslim. A religion that sanctions lying can logically not be the truth. It can only come from the Father of Lies, Satan. (John 8:44)

## You can break an oath if you have a better alternative 

[Riyad as-Salihin 1716](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:1716)

> The Messenger of Allah said, "When you swear an oath and consider something else to be better than it, make expiation for your oath and do the thing that is better."

Islam is based on lies and dishonesty.

## Allah has ordained for the breaking of oaths

Surah 66:2

> Allah has already ordained for you ˹believers˺ the way to absolve yourselves from your oaths. For Allah is your Guardian. And He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.


## Breaking an oath comes with ridiculously trivial consequences 

Surah 5:89

> Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. 

Just label an oath "thoughtless" and you don't have to hold your word. Otherwise you can just pay your way cheaply or by exposing yourself to minor inconvenience.



# Art and entertainment is prohibited


## Music and singing is a sin

[Sunan Ibn Majah 4020](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:4020)

> “People among my nation will drink wine, calling it by another name, and musical instruments will be played for them and singing girls (will sing for them). Allah will cause the earth to swallow them up, and will turn them into monkeys and pigs.”

Listening to music will cause you to be turned into a pig. But rape is totally fine.

### Poetry is a sin {#poetry}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 6155](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6155)

> Allah's Messenger; said, "It is better for anyone of you that the inside of his body be filled with pus which may consume his body, than it be filled with poetry."

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 3759](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3759)
- [Sunan Ibn Majah 3760](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3760)

## Backgammon is forbidden

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3763](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3763)

> Whoever plays backgammon, it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.

# Racism

## Blacks are worth half as much

Muhammad owned and traded black slaves. The going rate was two black slaves for one Arabic slave. 

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves).


## Black people were created for hell {#blacks-made-for-hell}

[Mishkat al-Masabih 119](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:119)

> …“God created Adam when He created him and struck his right shoulder and brought forth his offspring white like small ants. And he struck his left shoulder and brought forth his offspring black as though they were charcoal. Then He said to the party on his right side, ‘To paradise, and I do not care’ and He said to the party in his left shoulder, ‘To hell, and I do not care’.”

According to Muhammed, white people are destined for heaven and black people are destined for hell.

## Those condemned by Allah turns black {#blackface-hell}

Surah 3:106-107

> on a day when some faces are whitened and some faces are blackened. So as for those whose faces were blackened: “Did you deny after having attained faith?” Then taste the punishment on account of what you used to deny. And as for those whose faces were whitened—(they are) in Allah’s mercy; therein they abide.

## Black people symbolize disease {#black-disease}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 7039](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7039)

> …I saw in a dream a black woman with unkempt hair going out of Medina and settling at Mahai'a. I interpreted that as a symbol of the epidemic of Medina being transferred to Mahai'a…

When Muhammad sees a black woman in a dream he automatically assumes she represents an epidemic.


## Turks look like their faces were hit with a hammer {#turks}

[Sahih Muslim 2912 d](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2912d)

> The Last Hour would not come until the Muslims fight with the Turks-a people whose faces would be like hammered shields wearing clothes of hair and walking (with shoes) of hair.

Another description of Turks:

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2928](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2928)

> …The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Turks; people with small eyes, red faces, and flat noses. Their faces will look like shields coated with leather…

## Ethiopians have heads like raisins {#raisin-heads}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 693](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:693)

> "Listen and obey (your chief) even if an Ethiopian whose head is like a raisin were made your chief."

See also [Sahih al-Bukhari 7142](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7142)

## Use of racist slurs {#nword}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2906, 2907](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2906)

> It was the day of Id when **negroes** used to play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah's Messenger or he himself asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and **he was saying, "Carry on, negroes!**" When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough. I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.

According to Muhammad, it seems that black people are only good for entertainment and should be addressed in a condescending way.

## Muhammad didn't like black dogs {#black-dogs}

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3205](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3205)

> Were it not that dogs form one of the communities, I would have commanded that they be killed. But kill those that are all black...

## Black dogs are satanic

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 750](https://sunnah.com/nasai:750)

> I (one of the narrators)said: "What is the difference between a black dog, a yellow one and a red one?" He said: I asked the Messenger of Allah just like you and he said:"The black dog is a shaitan."







# Sexuality

## Islam promotes pedophilia

### Mohammed raped a nine year old girl 

Since children are incapable of understanding or consenting to sexual acts, any sexual act conducted with a child is an act of rape.

Muhammad, the example that all Muslims must follow, was a child rapist.

[Sahih al Bukhari 3896](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3896)

> Khadija died three years before the Prophet departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and **then he married Aisha when she was a girl of six years of age, and he consumed that marriage when she was nine years old.**

Aisha, the favorite wife of Muhammad, was 6 years old when Muhammad married her, and he had sex with their when she was only 9 years old. 

This is what Aisha herself said:

[Sunan an Nasa'i 3378](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378)

> "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and **I used to play with dolls.**"

The last part is important because many lying Muslims try to claim that Aisha was many years older, or that she was "mature for her age". But a child of 9 that plays with dolls is not mature for their age. Sahih al Bukhari explains that the playing with dolls means that she had not even entered puberty:

[Sahih al Bukhari 6130](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130)

> Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger  used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was **a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.**) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)

Aisha was prepubescent, still playing with dolls together with her playmates. Dolls are usually forbidden but were allowed for Aisha since she was a "little girl", so young that normal Islamic rules didn't yet apply to her.

- [Sunnah Abu Dawud 2121](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2121)

### Muhammad was flabbergasted that other men were not pedophiles

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5080](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5080)

> Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Messenger said to me, "What type of lady have you married?" I replied, "I have married a matron' He said, "Why, don't you have a liking for the virgins and for fondling them?" Jabir also said: Allah's Messenger said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'

The fact that other men are not drawn to sexually abuse children makes Muhammad shocked.


## Muhammad tongue-kissed a little boy

Muhammad's list for children was not limited to little girls. Little boys were not safe from this creep either.

[Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 1183](https://sunnah.com/adab:1183)

> …Then he said, 'Where is the little one? Call the little one to me.' Hasan came running and jumped into his lap. Then he put his hand in his beard. Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, **opened his mouth and put his mouth in his mouth**. Then he said, O Allah, I love him, so love him and the one who loves him!'"

### The Quran promotes child marriage

Surah 65:1 gives us the context for the passage in Surah 65:1-4: "When you intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period"". This passage is about the rules for the waiting period when you divorce a woman that she has to wait before she can remarry. In order to dis or e a woman you must first have had married her.

Surah 65:4 says:

> As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated** as well. As for those who are pregnant, their waiting period ends with delivery. And whoever is mindful of Allah, He will make their matters easy for them.

So pregnant women have to wait until delivery. Those "past the age of menstruation", menopausal, have to wait 3 months.

But, on the other side of that spectrum, those who have **not** menstruated, that is **prepubescent girls**, also have to wait 3 months before remarriage.

So in other words, the Quran outright condones and facilitates marrying children!

## Rape

### Captured women may be freely raped {#raping-captives}

[Sunan Abi Dawud 2155](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2155)

> Abu Sa’id Al Khudri said “The Apostle of Allaah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of Apostle of Allah were reluctant to have relations with the female captives because of their pagan husbands. So, Allaah the exalted sent down the Qur’anic verse “And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand posses.” This is to say that they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period.

**Those captives whom your right hand posses** means captives taken in war. The Muslims at this battle, horny perverts though they were, at least had the basic human decency of not raping women in front of their husbands. So this verse that Muhammad conveniently came up with makes it permissible for Muslim men to rape women that they take captive.

[Quran 4:24](https://quran.com/4/24)

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession...

### Impregnating rape victims is of no concern

[Sahih Muslim 1438a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1438a)

> We went out with Allah's Messenger on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing [interrupted coitus]. But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah's Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

Not only are Muslims allowed to rape women, but can just discard them like trash and not bother about them becoming pregnant.



## Muslims men can have sex slaves

Surah 4:3 

> If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their ˹due˺ rights ˹if you were to marry them˺, then marry other women of your choice—two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then ˹content yourselves with˺ one or those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession.

The footnote on quran.com says "A bondwoman is **a female slave** that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war".

A muslim man can freely use his female slaves for sex.

Surah 33:50

> O Prophet! We have **made lawful** for you your wives to whom you have paid their ˹full˺ dowries as well as those ˹bondwomen˺ in your possession, whom Allah has granted you... We have ordained for the believers in relation to their wives and those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession.

"Made lawful" means that he can have sex with female slaves.

Surah 23:5-6; 70:29-30

> [Sucessful are the believers...] those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those [bondswomen] in their possession, for then they are free from blame

This passage says that a muslim should be chaste except with their wives (plural) or "those their right hand posesses", which would be women they have taken captive in war or bought as slaves. It's allowed for muslim men to have slaves that they have sex with and these slave women can not refuse them.

Surah 4:24

> Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession.

They're not allowed to have sex with married women **except** if these **married women** have been captured in battle. Then it is allowed to have sex with these **married women**.









# Slavery

See also [Muhammad and slavery](#muhammad-and-slavery), [Sex slaves](#sex-slaves)

## Runaway slaves lack protection

[Mishkat al-Masabih 3350](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:3350)

> If any slave runs away protection does not apply to him.

Compare to the Mosaic law in Deuteronomy 23:15-16:

> “You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place that he shall choose within one of your towns, wherever it suits him. You shall not wrong him.

## Gifting slaves is better than freeing them

[Sahih Muslim 999](https://sunnah.com/muslim:999)

> Maimuna bint Harith reported that she set free a slave-girl during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah and she made a mention of that to the Messenger of Allah and he said: Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have a greater reward.

## Value of slaves

[Muwatta Malik Book 20, Hadith 243](https://sunnah.com/urn/409590)

> The value of the newly-born slave is fifty dinars, and that is one-tenth of what the blood-money for the mother would be.

## Black slaves are worth half of Arab slaves {#black-slaves-worth-less}

See [Muhammad traded black slaves](#black-slaves), [Racism](#racism).

## You may flog your slaves (and your wife) {#flog-slaves}

[Sahih al-Bukhari 5204](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5204)

> The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."

## Slaves should be flogged for sins


[Sahih al-Bukhari 6837, 6838](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6837)

> The verdict of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sought about an unmarried slave girl guilty of illegal intercourse. He replied, "If she commits illegal sexual intercourse, then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (after that for the second time), then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (for the third time), then flog her (fifty stripes) and sell her for even a hair rope."

> Malik related to me from Nafi that a slave was in charge of the slaves in the khumus and he forced a slave-girl among those slaves against her will and had intercourse with her. Umar ibn al-Khattab had him flogged and banished him, and he did not flog the slave-girl because the slave had forced her.

# Theft


## Plundering is ok if no one is watching

[Sahih al Bukhari 6772](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6772)

> … when a robber robs and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing it.…

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3936](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3936)

> …the plunderer, at the time he is plundering with the people looking on, is not a believer.

[Sunan Ibn Majah 3935](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3935)

> “Whoever plunders openly is not one of us.”

So plundering only makes a Muslim a nonbeliever under the condition that they do it openly when someone is watching. If it's done in secret it's no problem.



# Violence and Jihad 


See also [Muhammad and violence](/islam/muhammad/#muhammad-violence).

## Standing orders to fight the world

### What triggered Jihad {#allah-allows-jihad}

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3085](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3085)

> “When the Prophet was expelled from Makkah, … it was revealed: ‘Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is able to give them (believers) victory.’ Then I knew that there would be fighting.” Ibn Abbas said: “This is the first Verse that was revealed concerning fighting.”

When Muhammad and his tiny band of followers were kicked out of Mecca for being a nuisance, Muhammad had a convenient revelation (Surah 23:39) where Allah gave him permission to convert his cult into the death machine that has plagued mankind since.


### Fight the unbelievers until they convert

[Sahih al-Bukhari 25](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:25)

> Allah's Messenger said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to *fight against the people* until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then *they save their lives and property from me* except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."


[Sahih al-Bukhari 6924, 6925](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6924)

> …[Muhammad] said: 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, ' and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me…

- [Sunan Ibn Majah 3929](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:3929)

### "Kill unbelievers wherever you find them"

Surah 4:89

> They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,

Do not befriend unbelievers but **seize them and kill them wherever you find them**.

Surah 4:91

> You will find others who wish to be safe from you and their own people. Yet they cannot resist the temptation ˹of disbelief or hostility˺. If they do not keep away, offer you peace, or refrain from attacking you, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. We have given you full permission over such people.

If someone just wants to **be safe from** Islam and just want to live their life in peace and not be bothered, then **seize them and kill them** too.

### Behead enemies

[Quran 47:4](https://quran.com/47/4?translations=149)

> Thus, when you encounter those who have denied, strike at their necks. Then when you have subjugated them, bind them firmly…

### Behead unbelievers

Surah 8:12

> … I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.”

Ever wondered why Islamic terrorists behead their victims? It's by the book.

### Terrorizing and killing unbelievers

Surah 3:151-152

> We will **throw terror into the hearts** of those who have denied because they associated with Allah (partners) for which He bestowed from on high no authority. And their shelter is the Fire, and how miserable is the dwelling of the unjust! And very truly Allah fulfilled His promise to you **as you killed them** by His permission, until when you faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love: …

Allah will use **terror** against unbelievers. By what method? By Muslims **killing them by His permission**. And then Allah will burn them in **the Fire** forever. But is this a coincidence? No, if a Muslims had a shred of humanity and **faltered and disagreed with each other about the matter** whether terrorism is good, Allah sees that as them having **disobeyed** him.



## View on violence and terrorism


### Fighting is the second best deed in Islam

[Sahih al-Bukhari 26](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:26)

> Allah's Messenger was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and His Apostle (Muhammad). The questioner then asked, "What is the next in goodness? He replied, "To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's Cause."


### Jihadis are rewarded with booty and paradise

[Sahih al-Bukhari 36](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:36)

> The Prophet said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). 

### Those who die for Allah are the best of people

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3106](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3106)

> Among the best of the people is a man who strives in the cause of Allah on the back of his horse, or on the back of his camel, or on his own two feet, until death comes to him.

### The best jihad is where blood is shed


[Sunan Ibn Majah 2794](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:2794)

> It was narrated that ‘Amr bin ‘Abasah said: “I came to the Prophet and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, which Jihad is best?’ He said: ‘(That of a man) whose blood is shed and his horse is wounded.’”

### Allah likes terrorists more than peaceful Muslims 

Surah 4:95

>  Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.…

### Fighting is obligatory for Muslims 

Surah 2:216

> Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know.

Apparently Allah thinks violence is good for humans. 


### Muslims "kill and are killed" for Allah

Surah 9:111

> Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. **They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed**. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.

In order to get paradise a Muslim must sell his soul to Allah, and they do this by fighting for Allah, Killing and being killed.

### Muslims not fighting are hypocrites

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3097](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3097)

> "Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy."

### Muslims not fighting for Islam are punished with hell

Surah 8:15-16

> O believers! When you face the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs to them. And whoever does so on such an occasion—unless it is a manoeuvre or to join their own troops—will earn the displeasure of Allah, and their home will be Hell. What an evil destination!

A Muslim who chickens out and turns his back on a disbeliever will go to hell.


### Killing disbelievers guarantees immunity from hell

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3109](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3109)

> Two will never be gathered together in the Fire: A Muslim who killed a disbeliever then tried his best and did not deviate.

[Sunan an-Nasa'i 3116](https://sunnah.com/nasai:3116)

> Anyone whose feet become dusty in the cause of Allah, he will be forbidden to the Fire


## View on those who resist Islamic violence 


### Resisting Islam is severely punished

Surah 5:33

> Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land**. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.

In case you wage war against Islam, for example by exposing what a horrible ideology it is, your punishment is **death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land** and then to burn in hell for all eternity.


### Even stones will help jihadists to kill Jews 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 2926](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2926)

> …"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

## Muslims can indiscriminately kill innocent civilians 

[Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012)

> The Prophet … was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." I also heard the Prophet saying, "The institution of Hima (sanctuary)[^hima] is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle."

So his men, having a shred of humanity, asked about the possibility of killing non-combatant women and children. Muhammad said that it doesn't matter, they're all the same, so it's ok to kill innocent civilians. No mercy.

[^hima]: In the context of warfare in Islamic teachings, the term "hima" is sometimes used to denote a protected zone or area during times of conflict. It signifies a space where civilians and their property are safeguarded from harm. The Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of protecting Muslim non-combatants, including women, children, and the elderly, and avoiding unnecessary destruction during warfare. As pointed out in [Sahih al-Bukhari 3012](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3012), Hima is invalid for non-Muslims though. Muslims do not need to care about innocent bystanders but can just go on killing women and children indiscriminately.
