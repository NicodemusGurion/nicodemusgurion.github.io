> <span id="v1">1</span> Praise the name of your Lord the Most High,

> <span id="v2">2</span> Who createth, then disposeth;

> <span id="v3">3</span> Who measureth, then guideth;

> <span id="v4">4</span> Who bringeth forth the pasturage,

> <span id="v5">5</span> Then turneth it to russet stubble.

> <span id="v6">6</span> We shall make you read (O Muhammad) so that you shalt not forget

> <span id="v7">7</span> Save that which Allah willeth. See! He knoweth the disclosed and that which still is hidden;

> <span id="v8">8</span> And We shall ease your way unto the state of ease.

> <span id="v9">9</span> Therefor remind (men), for of use is the reminder.

> <span id="v10">10</span> He will heed who feareth,

> <span id="v11">11</span> But the most hapless will flout it,

> <span id="v12">12</span> He who will be flung to the great Fire

> <span id="v13">13</span> Wherein he will neither die nor live.

> <span id="v14">14</span> He is successful who groweth,

> <span id="v15">15</span> And remembereth the name of his Lord, so prayeth,

> <span id="v16">16</span> But you prefer the life of the world

> <span id="v17">17</span> Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.

> <span id="v18">18</span> See! This is in the former scrolls.

> <span id="v19">19</span> The Books of Abraham and Moses.
