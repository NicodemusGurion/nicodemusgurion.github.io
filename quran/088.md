> <span id="v1">1</span> Hath there come to you tidings of the Overwhelming ?

> <span id="v2">2</span> On that day (many) faces will be downcast,

> <span id="v3">3</span> Toiling, weary,

> <span id="v4">4</span> Scorched by burning fire,

> <span id="v5">5</span> Drinking from a boiling spring,

> <span id="v6">6</span> No food for them save bitter thorn-fruit

> <span id="v7">7</span> Which does not nourish nor release from hunger.

> <span id="v8">8</span> In that day other faces will be calm,

> <span id="v9">9</span> Glad for their effort past,

> <span id="v10">10</span> In a high Garden

> <span id="v11">11</span> Where they hear no idle speech,

> <span id="v12">12</span> Wherein is a gushing spring,

> <span id="v13">13</span> Wherein are couches raised

> <span id="v14">14</span> And goblets set at hand

> <span id="v15">15</span> And cushions ranged

> <span id="v16">16</span> And silken carpets spread.

> <span id="v17">17</span> Will they not regard the camels, how they are created ?

> <span id="v18">18</span> And the heaven, how it is raised ?

> <span id="v19">19</span> And the hills, how they are set up ?

> <span id="v20">20</span> And the earth, how it is spread ?

> <span id="v21">21</span> Remind them, for you are but a remembrancer,

> <span id="v22">22</span> You are not at all a warder over them.

> <span id="v23">23</span> But whoso is averse and disbelieveth,

> <span id="v24">24</span> Allah will punish him with direst punishment.

> <span id="v25">25</span> See! to Us is their return

> <span id="v26">26</span> And Ours their reckoning.
