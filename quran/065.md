> <span id="v1">1</span> O Prophet! When you (men) put away women, put them away for their (legal) period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them not from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah; and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits, he verily wrongeth his soul. You knowest not: it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.

> <span id="v2">2</span> Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he has no expectation. And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. See! Allah bringeth His command to pass. Allah has set a measure for all things.

> <span id="v4">4</span> And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if you doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And for those with child, their period shall be till they bring forth their burden. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him.

> <span id="v5">5</span> That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth to you. And whoso keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward for him.

> <span id="v6">6</span> Lodge them where you dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not so as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them till they bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them their due payment and consult together in kindness; but if you make difficulties for one another, then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child).

> <span id="v7">7</span> Let him who has abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose provision is measured, let him spend of that which Allah has given him. Allah asketh nothing of any soul save that which He has given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship, ease.

> <span id="v8">8</span> And how many a community revolted against the ordinance of its Lord and His messengers, and We called it to a stern account and punished it with dire punishment,

> <span id="v9">9</span> So that it tasted the ill-effects of its conduct, and the consequence of its conduct was loss.

> <span id="v10">10</span> Allah has prepared for them stern punishment; so keep your duty to Allah, O men of understanding! O you who believe! Now Allah has sent down to you a reminder,

> <span id="v11">11</span> A messenger reciting to you the revelations of Allah made plain, that He may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness to light. And whosoever believeth in Allah and does right, He will bring him into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. Allah has made good provision for him.

> <span id="v12">12</span> Allah it is who has created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof. The commandment cometh down among them slowly, that you may know that Allah is Able to do all things, and that Allah surroundeth all things in knowledge.
