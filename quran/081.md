> <span id="v1">1</span> When the sun is overthrown,

> <span id="v2">2</span> And when the stars fall,

> <span id="v3">3</span> And when the hills are moved,

> <span id="v4">4</span> And when the camels big with young are abandoned,

> <span id="v5">5</span> And when the wild beasts are herded together,

> <span id="v6">6</span> And when the seas rise,

> <span id="v7">7</span> And when souls are reunited,

> <span id="v8">8</span> And when the girl-child that was buried alive is asked

> <span id="v9">9</span> For what sin she was slain,

> <span id="v10">10</span> And when the pages are laid open,

> <span id="v11">11</span> And when the sky is torn away,

> <span id="v12">12</span> And when hell is lighted,

> <span id="v13">13</span> And when the Garden is brought nigh,

> <span id="v14">14</span> (Then) every soul will know what it has made ready.

> <span id="v15">15</span> Oh, but I call to witness the planets,

> <span id="v16">16</span> The stars which rise and set,

> <span id="v17">17</span> And the close of night,

> <span id="v18">18</span> And the breath of morning

> <span id="v19">19</span> That this is in truth the word of an honoured messenger,

> <span id="v20">20</span> Mighty, established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne,

> <span id="v21">21</span> (One) to be obeyed, and trustworthy;

> <span id="v22">22</span> And your comrade is not mad.

> <span id="v23">23</span> Surely he beheld Him on the clear horizon.

> <span id="v24">24</span> And he is not avid of the Unseen.

> <span id="v25">25</span> Nor is this the utterance of a devil worthy to be stoned.

> <span id="v26">26</span> Whither then go you ?

> <span id="v27">27</span> This is nothing else than a reminder unto creation,

> <span id="v28">28</span> Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight.

> <span id="v29">29</span> And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation.
