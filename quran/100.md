> <span id="v1">1</span> By the snorting courses,

> <span id="v2">2</span> Striking sparks of fire

> <span id="v3">3</span> And scouring to the raid at dawn,

> <span id="v4">4</span> Then, therewith, with their trail of dust,

> <span id="v5">5</span> Cleaving, as one, the centre (of the foe),

> <span id="v6">6</span> See! man is an ingrate unto his Lord

> <span id="v7">7</span> And see! he is a witness unto that;

> <span id="v8">8</span> And see! in the love of wealth he is violent.

> <span id="v9">9</span> Knows he not that, when the contents of the graves are poured forth

> <span id="v10">10</span> And the secrets of the breasts are made known,

> <span id="v11">11</span> On that day will their Lord be perfectly informed concerning them.
