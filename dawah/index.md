# Popular nonsense

- ["Rebekah was 3 years old when she married Isaac"](rebekah-3)
- ["The Bible has been corrupted"](Bible-currupted)
- ["Jesus never said 'I am God'"](jesus-never-claimed-to-be-god)
- ["Jesus was not crucified"](jesus-not-crucified)

# Attacking the Bible 

Notice that since the Quran affirms the authority, preservation, and inspiration of the Bible as something that the Quran and Islam rests upon, then any attack upon these means an attack upon the Quran and Islam itself. This is the foundation of the classic [Islamic dilemma](/islamic-dilemma), the dilemma that proves that Islam is false no matter what Muslims say.
