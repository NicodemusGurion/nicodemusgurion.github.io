**Ipse dixit** is a Latin phrase meaning “he himself said it.” It refers to an assertion made without supporting evidence, relying solely on the authority of the speaker. In logical fallacies, an ipse dixit fallacy occurs when a claim is assumed to be true just because someone (often an authority figure) asserts it, without providing proof or reasoning.

Key Characteristics of Ipse Dixit:

- No evidence provided – The claim is simply stated as fact.
- Relies on authority or self-reference – The truth of the statement is based only on the speaker’s authority, not on independent verification.
- Unfalsifiable or unquestionable – If challenged, the response is often just repetition of the claim rather than actual support.
