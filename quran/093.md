> <span id="v1">1</span> By the morning hours

> <span id="v2">2</span> And by the night when it is stillest,

> <span id="v3">3</span> your Lord has not forsaken you nor does He hate you,

> <span id="v4">4</span> And verily the latter portion will be better for you than the former,

> <span id="v5">5</span> And verily your Lord will give to you so that you will be content.

> <span id="v6">6</span> Did He not find you an orphan and protect (you) ?

> <span id="v7">7</span> Did He not find you wandering and direct (you) ?

> <span id="v8">8</span> Did He not find you destitute and enrich (you) ?

> <span id="v9">9</span> Therefore the orphan oppress not,

> <span id="v10">10</span> Therefore the beggar drive not away,

> <span id="v11">11</span> Therefore of the bounty of your Lord be your discourse.
