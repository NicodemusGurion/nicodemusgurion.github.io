> <span id="v1">1</span> No, I swear by this city -

> <span id="v2">2</span> And you are an indweller of this city -

> <span id="v3">3</span> And the begetter and that which he begat,

> <span id="v4">4</span> We verily have created man in an atmosphere:

> <span id="v5">5</span> Does he think that none has power over him ?

> <span id="v6">6</span> And he said: I have destroyed vast wealth:

> <span id="v7">7</span> Does he think that none beholdeth him ?

> <span id="v8">8</span> Did We not assign to him two eyes

> <span id="v9">9</span> And a tongue and two lips,

> <span id="v10">10</span> And guide him to the parting of the mountain ways ?

> <span id="v11">11</span> But he has not attempted the Ascent -

> <span id="v12">12</span> Ah, what will convey to you what the Ascent is! -

> <span id="v13">13</span> (It is) to free a slave,

> <span id="v14">14</span> And to feed in the day of hunger.

> <span id="v15">15</span> An orphan near of kin,

> <span id="v16">16</span> Or some poor wretch in misery,

> <span id="v17">17</span> And to be of those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and exhort one another to pity.

> <span id="v18">18</span> Their place will be on the right hand.

> <span id="v19">19</span> But those who disbelieve Our revelations, their place will be on the left hand.

> <span id="v20">20</span> Fire will be an awning over them.
