| <span id="v1" data-verse="89:1" data-tags="">1</span> | By the Dawn | |
| <span id="v2" data-verse="89:2" data-tags="">2</span> | And ten nights, | |
| <span id="v3" data-verse="89:3" data-tags="">3</span> | And the Even and the Odd, | |
| <span id="v4" data-verse="89:4" data-tags="">4</span> | And the night when it departeth, | |
| <span id="v5" data-verse="89:5" data-tags="">5</span> | There surely is an oath for thinking man. | |
| <span id="v6" data-verse="89:6" data-tags="">6</span> | Dost thou not consider how thy Lord dealt with (the tribe of) A'ad, | |
| <span id="v7" data-verse="89:7" data-tags="">7</span> | With many-columned Iram, | |
| <span id="v8" data-verse="89:8" data-tags="">8</span> | The like of which was not created in the lands; | |
| <span id="v9" data-verse="89:9" data-tags="">9</span> | And with (the tribe of) Thamud, who clove the rocks in the valley; | |
| <span id="v10" data-verse="89:10" data-tags="">10</span> | And with Pharaoh, firm of might, | |
| <span id="v11" data-verse="89:11" data-tags="">11</span> | Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands, | |
| <span id="v12" data-verse="89:12" data-tags="">12</span> | And multiplied iniquity therein ? | |
| <span id="v13" data-verse="89:13" data-tags="">13</span> | Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment. | |
| <span id="v14" data-verse="89:14" data-tags="">14</span> | Lo! thy Lord is ever watchful. | |
| <span id="v15" data-verse="89:15" data-tags="">15</span> | As for man, whenever his Lord trieth him by honouring him, and is gracious unto him, he saith: My Lord honoureth me. | |
| <span id="v16" data-verse="89:16" data-tags="">16</span> | But whenever He trieth him by straitening his means of life, he saith: My Lord despiseth me. | |
| <span id="v17" data-verse="89:17" data-tags="">17</span> | Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan | |
| <span id="v18" data-verse="89:18" data-tags="">18</span> | And urge not on the feeding of the poor. | |
| <span id="v19" data-verse="89:19" data-tags="">19</span> | And ye devour heritages with devouring greed. | |
| <span id="v20" data-verse="89:20" data-tags="">20</span> | And love wealth with abounding love. | |
| <span id="v21" data-verse="89:21" data-tags="">21</span> | Nay, but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding, | |
| <span id="v22" data-verse="89:22" data-tags="">22</span> | And thy Lord shall come with angels, rank on rank, | |
| <span id="v23" data-verse="89:23" data-tags="">23</span> | And hell is brought near that day; on that day man will remember, but how will the remembrance (then avail him) ? | |
| <span id="v24" data-verse="89:24" data-tags="">24</span> | He will say: Ah, would that I had sent before me (some provision) for my life! | |
| <span id="v25" data-verse="89:25" data-tags="">25</span> | None punisheth as He will punish on that day! | |
| <span id="v26" data-verse="89:26" data-tags="">26</span> | None bindeth as He then will bind. | |
| <span id="v27" data-verse="89:27" data-tags="">27</span> | But ah! thou soul at peace! | |
| <span id="v28" data-verse="89:28" data-tags="">28</span> | Return unto thy Lord, content in His good pleasure! | |
| <span id="v29" data-verse="89:29" data-tags="">29</span> | Enter thou among My bondmen! | |
| <span id="v30" data-verse="89:30" data-tags="">30</span> | Enter thou My Garden! | |
