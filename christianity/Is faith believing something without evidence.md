Believing something without evidence is not faith but gullibility. 

The word faith is synonymous with confidence or trust - the feeling that you can rely on something or someone. Faith as described in the Bible is never blind faith. There is not a single example of blind faith in the Bible. Faith is always based on evidence or previous experiences. 

Abraham had faith because God repeatedly spoke to him, revealed himself to him, and helped him again and again. 
Moses had faith because God revealed himself to him, spoke to him and helped him again and again. 
And when some people didn't have enough evidence, like Gideon, Eliezer and David, they took steps to get evidence and make sure before acting so that they could act in faith. 
The same is true for every example of faith in the Bible: They all had evidence and previous experience that God is trustworthy.

The kind of faith the Bible describes is the kind of faith a scientist has in the scientific method. Through repeatedly testing and gathering evidence, his confidence grows stronger both in his results and in his methods.
