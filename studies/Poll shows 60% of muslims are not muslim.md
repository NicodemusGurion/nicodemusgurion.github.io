"In June 2020, a research institute, the Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in IRAN (GAMAAN), conducted an online survey with the collaboration of Ladan Boroumand, co-founder of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran." 

Iran is an Islamic country whose government boasts that 99.5% of the population are Muslims. [Yet the poll shows that only 40% of the population actually identify as Muslim.](/public/pdf/GAMAAN-Iran-Religion-Survey-2020-English.pdf)

"In contrast with state propaganda that portrays Iran as a Shia nation, only 32% explicitly identified as such, while 5% said they were Sunni Muslim and 3% Sufi Muslim. Another 9% said they were atheists, along with 7% who prefer the label of spirituality. Among the other selected religions, 8% said they were Zoroastrians – which we interpret as a reflection of Persian nationalism and a desire for an alternative to Islam, rather than strict adherence to the Zoroastrian faith – while 1.5% said they were Christian."

While this may not be exactly representative of the entire Muslim world population, it is significant enough to conclude that a large swathe of those who call themselves Muslims only do so because otherwise the other Muslims will literally murder them.

It's not a good look when the only thing holding your community together is death threats.
